							<p> If money and wealth is the main character of the show, you would be its adversary because you believe that it is the main cause of chaos, hence, you inherently feel disconnected about it.</p>
							<p> An Adversary has a love/hate relationship with money. There are times that they reject money, thinking that it is the root of all evil and nothing good will come from having too much of it. There are also times that they feel good about being able to save to buy the things they want. They feel anxious talking about money but at the same time, they appreciate that it can buy the things that make them truly happy. </p>
							<p>An Adversary is a very good speaker, always carrying a purpose whenever they speak publicly. They listen to those who are exploited and helpless, then turn their woes and cries into calls for actions. An Adversary speaks with persuasion. They feel like they are blessed with such a talent to be the voice of many. </p>
							<p>Most Adversaries focus on their advocacies and let other people handle the financial matters to them.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								Why do I need to identify my superpowers and strengths?
							</h2>

							<p>Good question. Let&rsquo;s start with knowing the importance of superpowers and strengths.</p>

							<p>First of all, research has already shown that there are certain qualities that ancient humans have evolved overtime to resist extreme weather and endure stress. These amazing traits are what made humans stand the attack of nature and made them thrive in extreme situations.</p>

							<p>Research further concluded that these skills and abilities can still be further developed according to one&rsquo;s limits.</p>

							<p>The same goes to one&rsquo;s inner traits.</p>

							<p>One&rsquo;s superpowers are said to be the easiest ones to develop further &ndash; and these developed superpowers would be your fastest way to grow your wealth and cultivate a success mindset.</p>

							<p>As THE ADVERSARY, here are the superpowers which you can focus on to build your first wealth base:</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								Once You Focus On Something, You Are Unstoppable
							</h2>

							<p>This is one the best assets of an adversary. A focused person never gives up on any challenge. When they accept a responsibility, they commit to it until it&rsquo;s done. They do not let emotions stop them. They do not postpone anything that can be done today. They are very good multi-taskers, without leaving any important details behind.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								An Adversary Aims To Inspire
							</h2>

							<p>An Adversary knows how to stand on his belief. They believe that they are in the world to inspire and lead people towards better life, sans the talk about money. They believe that they can make their friends, family, and acquaintances find their own happiness that do not involve money. They relate their situation and good experiences to inspire people. An Adversary is a very good speaker with an aim to persuade.</p>

							<p>An adversary has the best commanding skills to make a person work towards their personal and team goals in a group. They have leadership qualities to bind people and team players together. Social entrepreneurs are usually the people with an adversary skills.</p>

							<p><strong>You Are Always Willing To Help And Take Actions</strong></p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								You Are Always Willing To Help And Take Actions
							</h2>

							<p>An Adversary&rsquo;s willingness to help generate ideas in his mind that can solve problems. They take actions to direct the issue, instead of looking and focusing on the alternatives. They believe that every problem has an end, and solutions come from people who help each other.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								An Adversary Values People
							</h2>

							<p>There is no such thing as impossible for an adversary. Everything can be done in the right way and no problem can never be solved with the help of people. They believe that each one of us has unique skills which fit perfectly in a puzzle. Everything will work in the end, as long as there is a leader which supports and guides everyone along the way.</p>

								You Find It Hard To Accept Money As A Good Thing
							</h2>

							<p>An Adversary does not really know how they will treat money. It&rsquo;s always a challenge for an Adversary to admit that they need more money to get the things that they will make them happy. They know that it is the root of all evil, that&rsquo;s why they avoid it as a subject on any conversation.</p>
							
							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								An Adversary Finds It Hard To Follow Saving Habits And Their Basic Financial Goals
							</h2>

							<p>This stems from the fact that they don&rsquo;t accept money as something that will be a catalyst of change and goodness among people. Adversaries lack financial goals because they avoid the thought that they need it to be content in life. But deep inside, they feel happy that they have enough money to sustain their needs and some of their wants.</p>

							<p>This is one of the hardest challenges for an Adversary. Their mindset is geared towards positive change and contentment without the money involved. They often forget that people will eventually look for money, and lack of knowledge about financial matters can result in disastrous consequences &ndash; such as lack of retirement fund, lack of health care budget, and lack of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								They Hate To Talk About Financial Matters
							</h2>

							<p>Bad money habits stem from lack of enough knowledge about handling finances. An adversary comfort zone is wherever money is not involved. They don&rsquo;t want to join the bandwagon when it is involved. Lack of financial literacy is a dangerous thing.</p>

							<p>A high-spirited personality paired with the right mindset to put every solution into action is a magic formula to instantly build your wealth. However, there are a lot of possible problems you are most possible to encounter.</p>

							<p>Let's start.</p>

							<ol>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Your Health Is Compromised</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>You Are Prone To Scams And Financial Advances</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Your Lifestyle Is Not Enough To Make You More Content And Happier</strong></li>
							</ol>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center"> Health Is Wealth</h2>

							<p>Investing in your health will be the first step towards wealth generation. A person may be earning enough but if his health is slowly taking a toll on his capacity thereby shortening his active life and limiting his movements, his assets and wealth will be put in vain.</p>

							<p>In 2019, the average <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical#:~:text=The%20National%20Health%20Expenditure%20Accounts,spending%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=U.S.%20health%20care%20spending%20grew,spending%20accounted%20for%2017.7%20percent." style="text-decoration:none"><u>health care costs</u></a> per person amounts to $11, 582. This goes up as you grow older and whether you are suffering from a serious ailment.</p>

							<p>The first step to diminish the costs and your risk of hospitalization is prevention and insurance procurement.</p>

							<p>In short, you need financial literacy how to manage risks like this.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">  
								Lack Of Financial Independence And Stability
							</h2>

							<p>The first stages of wealth generation involve being debt-free so you&rsquo;d be more financially free and independent.</p>

							<p>This will never happen for someone who finds it hard to talk and learn about money. People who are not clear about their financial goals are those who are far from being financially independent and happy.</p>

							<p>Your lack of financial literacy will also make you more vulnerable to scams and frauds. That is, because they will only talk so little about how money will work for you and your belief in the inherent goodness of people makes you an easy target. Adversaries are very friendly and them trusting their finances to other people increases the likelihood that your income will fall into the wrong hands.</p>

								 These problems can impact your wealth generation potential. Why is that so?
								</h2>

							<p><strong>Health And Success Are Inter-Related. </strong></p>
							<p>Did you know that a research by the <a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/sshw/message/message.php?p=Finance&amp;m=190" style="text-decoration:none"><u>Rutgers Cooperative Extension Small Steps to Health and Wealth (SSHW)</u></a> shows that overweight and obesity are associated with lower earnings, particularly for women in professional occupations? Employers spend a lot in developing programs to help people maintain good health habits and provide clinical care for employees who might be ill to make them even more productive at work.</p>

							<p><strong>Happiness Is A Great Motivation To Wealth Generation. </strong></p>
							<p>In a <a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/BLinpressb.pdf" style="text-decoration:none"><u>study</u></a> by Julia Boehm &amp; Sonja Lyubomirsky of the University of California, it was shown that contrary to the perception of many, happiness precedes success. It may sound contrary, especially if happiness is associated with money. However, it is also shown in different studies that happiness is associated with the income level. Sometimes, spending a little bit for our wants can become a big motivation which can result to better wealth generation.</p>

							<p><strong>Financial Literacy Is The First Step Towards Wealth Generation</strong></p>
							<p>The ever-changing world heavily affects the financial sector. Investments change their structure and fraudsters are becoming smarter to scam even the wisest rich. The best leaders and wise decision makers are financial literates. They know the basic accounting terms and how money works. Lack of financial literacy have the following consequences:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Lack of retirement fund</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Piling debts</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Lack of financial stability</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Inability to meet the expenses</li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Debt-Free Individuals Are Happier And More Contented</strong></p>

							<p>The thought that all your hard earned income will be yours only is already comforting. Debt and interests pertaining to it can deplete your savings. People who are living debt-free or close to being debt-free never have to worry about their financial obligations.</p>

							<p>It&rsquo;s not too late yet to remedy your negative vibrations (weaknesses) to counter the possible problems that a natural Adversary would eventually encounter in this lifetime.</p>

							<p>Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment.</p>

							<p>These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want to watch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance.</p>

							<p>However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It&rsquo;s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you.</p>

							<p>Here are the solutions catered just for an Adversary like you:</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center"> 
								#1 Start Subscribing To Financial Newsletters And Listening To Financial Podcasts
							</h2>

							<p>Does the thought of money and managing it still overwhelms and makes you uncomfortable? Can&rsquo;t stick to your budget because it&rsquo;s not the way you do things?</p>

							<p>Financial experts and bloggers can help you with that! They know simple hacks how to make these all easier. Financial blogs and books will teach you the right way to budget and to look at your salary from a different perspective. Many listeners and readers have already attested that this weekly habit changed them a lot.</p>

							<p>Most Adversaries are focused on their social movements with the goal to inspire. Most of them need a little jumpstart to recognize that money is not the root of evil &ndash; that money will only be evil if it is managed badly and if it&rsquo;s used to perpetuate fraud.</p>

							<p>Listening to financial podcasts will make you think of the future. Nobody had ever foreseen that this COVID pandemic will shut down a lot of business &ndash; even those which were at the top of the ladder. Most people today need money for sustenance and comfortable living. Everyone is looking for a job to make money legally. You can learn how to achieve this perspective from people who have experienced being in the same scenario.</p>

							<p>A weekly financial podcast / newsletter will highlight different aspects. Consider this as a kind of free coaching.</p>

							<p></p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center"> 
								#2 Monetize Your Leadership Skills
							</h2>

							<p>Most Adversaries are frustrated because their ideas cannot come to life. Yet, they have the best skills to lead a business and direct it to success. Every business idea obviously needs a fund and financial skills to organize this matter &ndash; something that an Adversary is yet to learn.</p>

							<p>An Adversary has the best persuasion skills. They can lead and motivate a team towards success. You&rsquo;ve already got the skills that most leaders today still lack.</p>

							<p>An Adversary is the best boss for service-based businesses.</p>

							<p>These are the top service-based niches for your best natural skills:</p>

							<ul>

							</ul>

							<p></p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center"> #2 Invest In Long-Term Investments</h2>

							<p>When you have enough funds to invest, opt for long-term investments. This is perfect for an Adversary, because this time, letting someone handle this aspect of your finances will do you more good. A professional fund manager will be the one to handle all these to give you peace of mind and to let you continue your advocacies.</p>

							<p>Why Long-Term Investments?</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Less time-consuming. You won&rsquo;t need to be bothered by the fluctuations of the value of the asset.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Higher returns of investment.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>What Are The Best Long-Term Investments?</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Stocks</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Corporate and Treasury Bonds</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Mutual Funds</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Where To Avail?</p>

							<p>Mutual Funds are offered by banks as well. As your local bank about their own investment fund managed by experts that are expected to yield huge returns after sometime. The good thing about this is that you don&rsquo;t need to learn the in-depths of stock trading because the experts will handle it for you. Unit Investment Trust or mutual funds managed by some retail banks require a minimum investment of $500.</p>

							<p>There are also online brokers and trading platforms which offer $0 fees and no minimum amount. You would only need to deposit such amount enough to buy a minimum number of stocks in your preferred company.</p>
