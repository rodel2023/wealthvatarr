                    <p>
                        You are one of the few people blessed with the <strong>best gifts</strong> not given to many. Your superpowers
                        are there (in fact, you know you can feel it in you!) but they are currently dormant. There are
                        endless possibilities given your <strong>unique set of gifts</strong> – which are just sitting and waiting for you
                        to realize it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just recently, things are getting tough on your part, isn’t it? Unfortunate circumstances have
                        happened which have surely worn you out over the past weeks. Things didn’t go as planned.
                        You spent time and effort and even sacrificed a lot but the results and the turn of events
                        just...didn’t favor you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I hope you don’t lose your spark and let those greatest attributes I’ve seen in you die just
                        because of these unfortunate incidents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just signs that <strong>big things are going to reveal</strong> themselves.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This is the time where your greatest superpower – that set of gifts I’m talking about – will be of
                        use to reveal even better things. Your natural gifts are product of your childhood dreams. These
                        dreams include wealth, quality relationships, good luck, and happiness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, your full potential is being hindered by the <strong>negative forces</strong> lurking around
                        someone with such an incredible set of gifts. These negative forces saw that your goals
                        are without clarity and that’s where they attack. It is <strong>critical that you realize what 
                        these are</strong> or you would never know which one would be your greatest enemy, resulting
                        in the futility of your natural gifts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you are ready to know about your natural gifts…and brave enough to meet your
                        weaknesses you didn’t have the courage to face before.

                        Thanks to your creative mind and the will to turn these ideas into income-generating projects, most people now have jobs to put food on the table! You working hard all the time will make you more financially independent sooner than you think!

                        The quote by Steve Jobs saying that "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." appeals to you the most. Your friends and comrades will agree that you’re the only one who will relate to this motto among your circle.

                    <p>
                        You teach people the art of frugality. You have the power to inspire them with your actions and in fact, you are a role model to most of your friends.

                        Your passion on the things and projects you create secures your future that you don’t have to be financially dependent to anyone anymore.

                        You make sure that all your time and efforts are devoted to create something beautiful and something that would give you financial security in the future.

                    <p>
                        You are the fastest one to accumulate wealth among the other wealth archetypes. You are the last one to be financially dependent even if the unforeseen happens.

                        Most people want to achieve bigger in life but entrust it all to good luck. You’d rather work hard and think of the most practical things to turn it into fruition rather than read about good luck and wish upon a star.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Mindset is a very powerful weapon that awakens your senses all the time. It’s the driving force to make changes and to turn around things in the most feasible way. It influences the way you behave and to rise immediately as soon as you fall.

                    <p>
                        This explains that even if your idea fails you, your comeback is always just around the corner. You spring back eagerly from failure thanks to your success mindset.

                    <p>
                        You radiate this mindset with other people. Your colleagues are secretly thanking you for this.

                        The Capitalists understand that the true meaning of assets are not valued by money. It comes in the form of investments and creations, too. Even a business’ goodwill is a valued asset for them.

                        Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO and the 5th richest man in the world, teaches the younger generations that the first step to success is to fix your mindset. If you want to start a company, ask yourself first what the problem is in the world that you want to solve and start from there.

                        <p>
                            In Science, we have always learned that energy balance is important. Consuming too
                            much energy and burning too little of it would result to the storage of body fat - and this
                            will lead to risks of diseases and organ malfunction in the long run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, let’s apply the same to our mind’s composition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A positive energy is not enough to bring you tremendous results and abundance.
                            Possessing your own gifts and strengths are not enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes, too much of this strength can lead to negative consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Too much of the negative energy will then open the gates to unforeseen events and
                            result to your goals getting delayed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is the same principle that celebrities and wealthy businessmen have been using for
                            years.

                            they’ve been possessing was taking so much control in their lives that their goals turned

                            Psychologists say that our financial decisions, including the unintelligent ones,
                            are affected by the subconsciousness
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This subconscious is seated on the deepest part of the mind - that which is not brought
                            by experiences, but is generally inherited.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is responsible for one’s belief, spirituality, and instincts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That subconsciousness can be understood and defined by these archetypes which can
                            tell patterns of behaviour and mindset.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first thing that mega-wealthy individuals who found this revelation did was to become aware of
                            their wealth archetype. From then on, they became aware of their behaviours, instinct,

                            Science has shown that any form of trauma -- be it finances, abuse, war or other unpleasant things -- actually affects you on a genetic level.

                        <p>
                            Epigenetics is the study of how prior behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.

                            In a sobering study published by the Society of Biological Psychiatry in November 2020, it concluded that if your ancestors encounter trauma like extreme poverty, the brain chemistry of the baby will be adversely affected.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            Even the most irreversible of circumstances can change. Where hearts start opening up... When messages from the Universe become more vivid...

                        <p>

                            You see. We at WealthAvatarr™ know the no.1 struggle most test-takers are facing is the ability to become a money magnet due to the Genetic Glass Ceiling.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            You’ll get the knowledge -- which is powerful in itself... But you do not get the tools to utilise them. To “magnetise” you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, we commissioned genetic-altering audio to be customised by Sound Engineers... Tuned to the right frequencies so you can start seeing the cash flow in.
