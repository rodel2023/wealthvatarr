							THE ADVERSARY
						</h2>

						<p>
							You are one of the few people blessed with the <strong>best gifts</strong> not given to many. Your
							superpowers are there (in fact, you know you can feel it in you!) but they are currently
							dormant. There are endless possibilities given your <strong>unique set of gifts</strong> – which are just
							sitting and waiting for you to realize it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just recently, things are getting tough on your part, isn’t it? Unfortunate circumstances
							have happened which have surely worn you out over the past weeks. Things didn’t go
							as planned. You spent time and effort and even sacrificed a lot but the results and the
							turn of events just...didn’t favor you.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope you don’t lose your spark and let those greatest attributes I’ve seen in you die
							just because of these unfortunate incidents.
						</p>
						<p>
							These are just signs that <strong>big things are going to reveal</strong> themselves.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This is the time where your greatest superpower – that set of gifts I’m talking about –
							will be of use to reveal even better things. Your natural gifts are product of your
							childhood dreams. These dreams include wealth, quality relationships, good luck, and
							happiness.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, your full potential is being hindered by the <strong>negative forces</strong> lurking around
							someone with such an incredible set of gifts. These negative forces saw that your goals
							are without clarity and that’s where they attack. It is <strong>critical that you realize what 
							these are</strong> or you would never know which one would be your greatest enemy, resulting
							in the futility of your natural gifts.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hope you are ready to know about your natural gifts…and brave enough to meet your
							weaknesses you didn’t have the courage to face before.
						</p>
						<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
							Your personality and behavior are those of THE ADVERSARY
						</h2>

						<p>
							If money and wealth is the main character of the show, you would be its adversary
							because you believe that it is the main cause of chaos, hence, you inherently feel
							disconnected about it.
						</p>

						<p>
							The quote saying that <i>“Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing
							in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants.”</i> By
							Benjamin Franklin appeals to you the most, among your friends and comrades.
						</p>
						<p>
							You think that money is inherently evil. You avoid talking about it all the time. In fact,
							you are most likely to create and lead social movement to find genuine happiness
							without money involved.
						</p>
						<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">

						<p>
							Everyone likes you because of your leadership skills and personality and your ability to
							inspire that you stand out from the others. You have the best public speaking skills and
							when you speak, you see to it that people are persuaded by what you want to say.
						</p>
						<p>
							You care about social injustice and you listen to those who are victims of it. You lead
							people towards their own path to happiness and success.
						</p>
						<p>
							An Adversary is passionate about the things he loves. Adversaries have a lot of ideas in
							their mind. They initiate activities towards one goal. They can unite a group. That’s
							because you see the value of people and their unique skills.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it comes to wealth generation, this is a very good skill. Leaders who utilize other
							people’s potential know that every goal can be accomplished by team effort.
						</p>
						<p>
							An adversary knows how to do such. Big leaders can learn a lot from them!
						</p>

						<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
							Here’s an additional good news – you carry some sort of good luck thanks to this
								hidden strength of yours
						</h2>
						<p>
							Your ability to act immediately is a valuable trait when it comes to wealth generation. 
						</p>

						<p>
							In fact, you’ve got the right mindset and self-confidence skills to generate a lot of
							money.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your mindset that you are capable of doing anything unlocks a great potential in you. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Mindset is a very powerful weapon that awakens your senses all the time. It’s the
							driving force to make changes and to turn around things in the most feasible way. It
							influences the way you behave and to rise immediately as soon as you fall.
						</p>
						<p>
							You radiate this mindset with other people. Your colleagues are secretly thanking you
							for this.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Adversaries have the potential to be the next big leader. They’ve got the skills and
							the right persuasion. They can influence people just by showing their confidence. They
							can make a huge impact inspiring others through their own example.
						</p>
						
						<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
							Take for example this popular person with the same mindset as yours.

							Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO and the 5th richest man in the world, teaches the
							younger generations that the first step to success is to fix your mindset. If you want to
							start a company, ask yourself first what the problem is in the world that you want to
							solve and start from there.
						</p>
						<p>
							After all, that’s how Facebook started. This social innovation aimed to connect Harvard
							students using better communication facilities. It was started for the use of a small

							Just like your personality type, his natural gift of developing such mindset made him one
							of the richest people in this modern world.

							THESE WONDERFUL GIFTS, HOWEVER, ARE BEING COUNTERED BY YOUR

							<p>
								Your strong emotions about money make it hard for you to proceed with your moneymaking goals. Your wealth generation ability still needs to be woken up or else, you
								would not be able to jumpstart your wealth journey.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whenever someone is talking about money, you’d think of all the excuses not to join or
								to gear the topic away from it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lack of financial literacy is a dangerous thing!
							</p>
							<p>
								This makes you entrust everything to good luck or let other people handle your financial
								matters for you.

							<p>
								In fact, your debts are piling up due to lack of budget to stick with. You still depend on
								other people, financially.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your financial independence and happiness is something that’s far from reality.
							</p>
							<p>
								And that’s the reason you need to heed this advice.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is your greatest source of obstacles that constantly brings you problems with
								regards to wealth, relationships, and happiness.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, I’m seeing that this negative energy still continues as we go along so...

							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								BEWARE OF THESE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS I’VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH SUCH
								WONDERFUL GIFTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED
							</h2>
							<p>
								The Adversaries find it hard to enjoy things and be contented in life. They often forget to
								appreciate money in the long run. They forgot that people, whether they like it or not,
								are fueled by their desire to live a comfortable life and money will significantly help with
								that.
							</p>
							<p>
								Adversaries are frustrated because they can’t fulfill their ideas and turn them to reality.
								They may focus on advocacies that their obligations to themselves are far from being
								fulfilled.
							</p>
							<p>
								For The Adversary, money is an uncomfortable topic. But unless they learn how to talk
								about it, their wealth generation journey will never come to fruition.

								DON’T TAKE THESE OBSTACLES FOR GRANTED.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Your gifts are being utilized at its minimal. Your greatest weaknesses are slowly taking
								over your potential hence, achieving your goals are taking so much time for now.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your anxious mind makes it hard for you to find that happiness you’ve always yearned
								for in your career, lifestyle, relationships, and wealth.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								Your timeline to achieve your goals are getting more and more extended because

								In Science, we have always learned that energy balance is important. Consuming too
								much energy and burning too little of it would result to the storage of body fat - and this
								will lead to risks of diseases and organ malfunction in the long run.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, let’s apply the same to our mind’s composition.
							</p>
							<p>
								A positive energy is not enough to bring you tremendous results and abundance.
								Possessing your own gifts and strengths are not enough.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes, too much of this strength can lead to negative consequences.
							</p>
							<p>
								Too much of the negative energy will then open the gates to unforeseen events and
								result to your goals getting delayed.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the same principle that celebrities and wealthy businessmen have been using for
								years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just like you, they only uncovered this at some point in their lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								They only uncovered it at some point where the negative energy they didn’t know
								they’ve been possessing was taking so much control in their lives that their goals turned
								seemingly hard to achieve.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-adversary text-center">
								Psychologists say that our financial decisions, including the unintelligent ones,
								are affected by the subconsciousness
							</h2>
							<p>
								This subconscious is seated on the deepest part of the mind - that which is not brought
								by experiences, but is generally inherited.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is responsible for one’s belief, spirituality, and instincts.
							</p>
							<p>
								That subconsciousness can be understood and defined by these archetypes which can
								tell patterns of behaviour and mindset.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first thing that mega-wealthy individuals who found this revelation did was to become aware of
								their wealth archetype. From then on, they became aware of their behaviours, instinct,
								and patterns. They found the source of their negative
								energies and became much more prepared to deal with the possible problems they are
								the most prone to encounter.
							</p>
							<p>
								This knowledge became one of their ultimate weapons to transcend the challenges
								coming to their way.

								Attaining finances gruelling like an uphill climb, yet disappearing like sand through your fingertips when you do get them.

								A burning frustration because the goalpost keeps moving, where the fulfilment of your dreams seem to be further and further away.

								Well, the answer is a resounding no.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Listen... It has nothing to do with your efforts. <i>Not at all.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								The main reason you're not manifesting the way you’re supposed to is because <strong>of this STARTLING stumbling block.</strong> 
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s actually the hidden reason behind the stark inequality in this world.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, while I admit circumstances are volatile at the moment... This 1 thing even can cause you to REMAIN poor even when times are good.

							<p>

							<p>
								You see... Your struggle with money didn’t just start with you.
							</p>
							<p>
								It began many generations ago.
							</p>
							<p>
								Science has shown that any form of trauma -- be it finances, abuse, war or other unpleasant things -- actually affects you on a genetic level.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								It’s named epigenetics.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Epigenetics is the study of how prior behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a sobering study published by the Society of Biological Psychiatry in November 2020, it concluded that if your ancestors encounter trauma like extreme poverty, the brain chemistry of the baby will be adversely affected.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, your mind can’t reach it’s full manifestation potential because the brain has been “handicapped” since birth.
							</p>
							<p>
								So if you’re fighting to make ends meet... It’s probably because your ancestors faced the same issue... And now you <strong>have a historical handicap.</strong>  
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								Here’s an illustration.

							<p>
								You may teach an arthritic patient all the steps to a specific ballroom dance... However, no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to replicate the steps properly. In fact, they may not be even able to replicate the steps at all.

							<p>
								You exert the energy... Try all you may... And then...

								When you say, “that person is blessed with good genes”... You hit the nail on the head!
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything they touch turns to gold, like King Midas.
							</p>
							<p>
								In an explosive 2011 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology, children who are brought up in affluent or poverty-stricken homes affect the epigenetics of their DNA.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can <strong>dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>Pay attention because that statement holds the key to your breakthrough.</i></strong>
							</p>

								In another study... Rich kids are naturally inclined to assert their will in life, whereas poor kids tend to shrink away in servitude.

								From Genetic Glass Ceiling to Genetic Jackpot!

								I’m going to repeat an earlier passage which holds the remarkable key.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>“Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.”</i></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, you’re born with <strong>the innate potential</strong> within you... It’s just switched off.
							</p>
							<p>
								The studies reveal poverty and abundance is really a difference of triggering the “on” switch for certain genetics.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>So How Do We Do That?</strong>
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								I Present to You “the Genetic Wealth Switch”
							</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>In other words, You Play Specific Frequencies That Turn On the Genes to Make Wealth</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								That may sound strange, but it's cutting edge science.  

								According to a revolutionary 2018 Kyoto University study in ScienceDaily... When mechanosensitive genes are subjected to audible sounds, the genes can actually be switched on or off.
