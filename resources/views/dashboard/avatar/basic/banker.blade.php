							THE BANKER
						</h2>

						<p>
							You are one of the few people blessed with the <strong>best gifts</strong> not given to many. Your superpowers
							are there (in fact, you know you can feel it in you!) but they are currently dormant. There are
							endless possibilities given your <strong>unique set of gifts</strong> – which are just sitting and waiting for you
							to realize it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just recently, things are getting tough on your part, isn’t it? Unfortunate circumstances have
							happened which have surely worn you out over the past weeks. Things didn’t go as planned.
							You spent time and effort and even sacrificed a lot but the results and the turn of events
							just...didn’t favor you.
						</p>
						<img src= "https://res.cloudinary.com/dohqthrfv/image/upload/v1649303998/WealthAvatarr/banker1_rh9xwj.png" class="img-intext" alt="" > 
						<p>
							I hope you don’t lose your spark and let those greatest attributes I’ve seen in you die just
							because of these unfortunate incidents.
						</p>
						<p>
							These are just signs that <strong>big things are going to reveal</strong> themselves.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This is the time where your greatest superpower – that set of gifts I’m talking about – will be of
							use to reveal even better things. Your natural gifts are product of your childhood dreams. These
							dreams include wealth, quality relationships, good luck, and happiness.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, your full potential is being hindered by the <strong>negative forces</strong> lurking around
							someone with such an incredible set of gifts. These negative forces saw that your goals
							are without clarity and that’s where they attack. It is <strong>critical that you realize what 
							these are</strong> or you would never know which one would be your greatest enemy, resulting
							in the futility of your natural gifts.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hope you are ready to know about your natural gifts…and brave enough to meet your
							weaknesses you didn’t have the courage to face before.
						</p>
						<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
							Your personality and behavior are those of THE BANKER
						</h2>

						<p>
							You are the most anxious about the thought of losing a cent from your bank account and
							personal vaults. But you are also not the type that would run out of money and your friends
							and colleagues envy you for that! Every cent you earn and spend are well accounted for.							
						</p>

						<p>
							The quote by John Tyler saying that “Wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of
							industry and the savings of frugality.” appeals to you the most, among your friends and
							comrades.
						</p>
						<p>
							You teach people the art of frugality. You have the power to inspire them with your actions and
							in fact, you are a role model to most of your friends.
						</p>

							<u>Your fear of becoming financially dependent.</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							This fear secures all your money which are all a product of your hard work and dedication.
						</p>
						<p>
							You make sure that all your cashflows are very well accounted for. You do all the accounting
							yourself and you definitely live within your budget. This is possible thanks to your very good way
							of handling money.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it comes to finances, you are the most disciplined and responsible. You never let a single
							dollar go without knowing where it would go. Your hard work and efforts on earning are never
							wasted because of this trait.
						</p>
						<p>
							Not a lot of people track their finances. And even if they do, they are not disciplined enough to
							hold back from spending it on things that are of no use to them.							
						</p>

						<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
							Take for example this popular person with the same frugal lifestyle as yours.

						<p>
							Your ability to act immediately is a valuable trait when it comes to wealth generation. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Warren Buffett lives with at least a $100 billion net worth. The 6th wealthiest man in the globe
							lives a simple and frugal lifestyle - which brings him happiness and contentment in life.
						</p>
						<p>
							He lives in the same residence he bought in 1958. He finds joy in buying cars at reduced prices.
							His breakfast is something that not a lot of people would expect for a billionaire’s breakfast. He
							enjoys a simple McDonald’s to start his day right.							 
						</p>
						<p>
							Just like your personality type, his natural gift of being content on simple things make him one
							of the richest people in this modern world.
						</p>
						
						<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
							Here’s an additional good news – you carry some sort of good luck thanks to this hidden strength of yours

						</h2>
						<p>
							You appreciate hard work and every penny you earn. You make sure your efforts are very well
							reciprocated - because this alone is one of your happiness.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your tendency to save, save, and save attracts appreciation from other people as well. Anyone
							who comes into your life is thankful because they learn a lesson from being with you.
						</p>
						<p>
							You encourage them to live frugally and save within their means.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Bankers are very trustworthy. A lot of people respect you because of that. They see how you
							can live within your means and never run out of money when you need it.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you continue using this natural gift of yours, you will never be financially dependent on
							anyone ever again. Your happiness, good luck, and wealth flow from this natural gift that only
							this personality type possesses.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that you know your calling…

								THESE WONDERFUL GIFTS, HOWEVER, ARE BEING
								COUNTERED BY YOUR GREATEST WEAKNESSES								
							</h2>

							<p>
								Your obsession with money itself hinders your natural gift to achieve your wealth and success
								goals in the shortest possible time! You grow anxious and are always scared to see your bank
								account diminishing, even though the funds would go to something where it can grow
								exponentially.
							</p>
							<p>
								You would rather have the money sit in the bank and withdraw it when the need arises. You do
								this because you feel this is the safest way to keep your wealth.								
							</p>
							<p>
								But the truth is...you are missing a lot of opportunities to multiply your money!
							</p>
							<p>
								Your obsession with money hinders you from spoiling yourself with the things you deserve.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your obsession hinders you from acquiring the best things that should be aiding you with your
								personal and professional growth.

							<p>
								You always settle on what’s the cheapest which are generally lower in quality.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is your greatest source of obstacles that constantly brings you problems with regards to
								wealth, relationships, and happiness.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, I’m seeing that this negative energy still continues as we go along so...
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								BEWARE OF THESE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS I’VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH
								SUCH WONDERFUL GIFTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED								
							</h2>
							<p>
								The Bankers are usually those who are the most distant with their family members and friends.
								They tend to avoid social gatherings to avoid spending money. They would rather keep it on
								their bank or spend it only when needed.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Banker’s tendency to attach a price tag on everything makes it hard for them to pay even on
								things they deserve.
							</p>
							<p>
								And even if they do...it won’t give them peace of mind after some time. Their anxious mind
								would somehow interrupt with their day-to-day tasks.

								DON’T TAKE THESE OBSTACLES FOR GRANTED.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Your gifts are being utilized at its minimal. Your greatest weaknesses are slowly taking over your
								potential hence, achieving your goals are taking so much time for now.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your anxious mind makes it hard for you to find that happiness you’ve always yearned for in
								your career, lifestyle, relationships, and wealth.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								Your timeline to achieve your goals are getting more and more

								uncovered

								In Science, we have always learned that energy balance is important. Consuming too
								much energy and burning too little of it would result to the storage of body fat - and this
								will lead to risks of diseases and organ malfunction in the long run.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, let’s apply the same to our mind’s composition.
							</p>
							<p>
								A positive energy is not enough to bring you tremendous results and abundance.
								Possessing your own gifts and strengths are not enough.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes, too much of this strength can lead to negative consequences.
							</p>
							<p>
								Too much of the negative energy will then open the gates to unforeseen events and
								result to your goals getting delayed.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the same principle that celebrities and wealthy businessmen have been using for
								years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just like you, they only uncovered this at some point in their lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								They only uncovered it at some point where the negative energy they didn’t know
								they’ve been possessing was taking so much control in their lives that their goals turned
								seemingly hard to achieve.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								Psychologists say that our financial decisions, including the unintelligent ones,
								are affected by the subconsciousness
							</h2>
							<p>
								This subconscious is seated on the deepest part of the mind - that which is not brought
								by experiences, but is generally inherited.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is responsible for one’s belief, spirituality, and instincts.
							</p>
							<p>
								That subconsciousness can be understood and defined by these archetypes which can
								tell patterns of behaviour and mindset.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first thing that mega-wealthy individuals who found this revelation did was to become aware of
								their wealth archetype. From then on, they became aware of their behaviours, instinct,
								and patterns. They found the source of their negative
								energies and became much more prepared to deal with the possible problems they are
								the most prone to encounter.
							</p>
							<p>
								This knowledge became one of their ultimate weapons to transcend the challenges
								coming to their way.

								Attaining finances gruelling like an uphill climb, yet disappearing like sand through your fingertips when you do get them.

								A burning frustration because the goalpost keeps moving, where the fulfilment of your dreams seem to be further and further away.

								Well, the answer is a resounding no.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Listen... It has nothing to do with your efforts. <i>Not at all.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								The main reason you're not manifesting the way you’re supposed to is because <strong>of this STARTLING stumbling block.</strong> 
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s actually the hidden reason behind the stark inequality in this world.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, while I admit circumstances are volatile at the moment... This 1 thing even can cause you to REMAIN poor even when times are good.

							<p>
								You see... Your struggle with money didn’t just start with you.
							</p>
							<p>
								It began many generations ago.
							</p>
							<p>
								Science has shown that any form of trauma -- be it finances, abuse, war or other unpleasant things -- actually affects you on a genetic level.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								It’s named epigenetics.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Epigenetics is the study of how prior behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a sobering study published by the Society of Biological Psychiatry in November 2020, it concluded that if your ancestors encounter trauma like extreme poverty, the brain chemistry of the baby will be adversely affected.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, your mind can’t reach it’s full manifestation potential because the brain has been “handicapped” since birth.
							</p>
							<p>
								So if you’re fighting to make ends meet... It’s probably because your ancestors faced the same issue... And now you <strong>have a historical handicap.</strong>  
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								Here’s an illustration.

							<p>
								You may teach an arthritic patient all the steps to a specific ballroom dance... However, no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to replicate the steps properly. In fact, they may not be even able to replicate the steps at all.

							<p>
								You exert the energy... Try all you may... And then...

							<p>
								<strong>THUD.</strong>

								When you say, “that person is blessed with good genes”... You hit the nail on the head!
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything they touch turns to gold, like King Midas.
							</p>
							<p>
								In an explosive 2011 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology, children who are brought up in affluent or poverty-stricken homes affect the epigenetics of their DNA.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can <strong>dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>Pay attention because that statement holds the key to your breakthrough.</i></strong>
							</p>

								In another study... Rich kids are naturally inclined to assert their will in life, whereas poor kids tend to shrink away in servitude.

							<p>
								From Genetic Glass Ceiling to Genetic Jackpot!
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m going to repeat an earlier passage which holds the remarkable key.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>“Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.”</i></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, you’re born with <strong>the innate potential</strong> within you... It’s just switched off.
							</p>
							<p>
								The studies reveal poverty and abundance is really a difference of triggering the “on” switch for certain genetics.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>So How Do We Do That?</strong>
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								I Present to You “the Genetic Wealth Switch”
							</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>In other words, You Play Specific Frequencies That Turn On the Genes to Make Wealth</strong>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								That may sound strange, but it's cutting edge science.  

								According to a revolutionary 2018 Kyoto University study in ScienceDaily... When mechanosensitive genes are subjected to audible sounds, the genes can actually be switched on or off.

								In layman terms, certain frequencies awaken the cells that spark abundance.
