							THE INFLUENCER
						</h2>

						<p>
							You are one of the few people blessed with the <strong>best gifts</strong> not given to many. Your superpowers
							are there (in fact, you know you can feel it in you!) but they are currently dormant. There are
							endless possibilities given your <strong>unique set of gifts</strong> – which are just sitting and waiting for you
							to realize it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just recently, things are getting tough on your part, isn’t it? Unfortunate circumstances have
							happened which have surely worn you out over the past weeks. Things didn’t go as planned.
							You spent time and effort and even sacrificed a lot but the results and the turn of events
							just...didn’t favor you.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope you don’t lose your spark and let those greatest attributes I’ve seen in you die just
							because of these unfortunate incidents.
						</p>
						<p>
							These are just signs that <strong>big things are going to reveal</strong> themselves.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This is the time where your greatest superpower – that set of gifts I’m talking about – will be of
							use to reveal even better things. Your natural gifts are product of your childhood dreams. These
							dreams include wealth, quality relationships, good luck, and happiness.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, your full potential is being hindered by the <strong>negative forces</strong> lurking around
							someone with such an incredible set of gifts. These negative forces saw that your goals
							are without clarity and that’s where they attack. It is <strong>critical that you realize what 
							these are</strong> or you would never know which one would be your greatest enemy, resulting
							in the futility of your natural gifts.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hope you are ready to know about your natural gifts…and brave enough to meet your
							weaknesses you didn’t have the courage to face before.
						</p>
						<h2 class="sub-header-influencer text-center">
							Your personality and behavior are those of THE INFLUENCER
						</h2>

						<p>
							Your social media accounts sure look like that of an influencer because of the expensive and
							beautiful things that you take photos of (and which you own). You love making good
							impressions and work hard to maintain it. Your charismatic personality indeed leaves a good
							impression on the people around you.
						</p>

						<p>
							The quote saying that “Happiness is buying yourself a present because you deserve it” appeals
							to you the most, among your friends and comrades.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your friends know you for being generous as well. They love getting along with your cheerful
							personality. And most of all…some of them tend to envy the material things you own and
							brought by your hard-earned money. They look up to you because of this unique capability.
						</p>

							You being the most self-confident person in the room and your ability to radiate radiance even
							at the most dull events.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thanks to your cheerful personality and the things you own which screams class and grace,
							people trust that you can do a job easily.
						</p>
						<p>
							You tend to help people as well, because of the fact that it can and it will raise your status in the
							society.
						</p>
						<p>
							You appreciate opportunities. Hardly every best opportunity that comes knocking to you slip
							from yours hands. This is your magnet to good luck.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everyone feels your power and authority every time you speak with confidence and eloquence.
							Your optimistic attitude will bring you to all the best places.
						</p>
						<h2 class="sub-header-influencer text-center">
							Here’s an additional good news – you carry some sort of good luck thanks to this hidden strength of yours

						<p>
							Your ability to radiate confidence, authority and connections with people can help you generate

						</p>

						<p>
							Your optimism and cheerfulness brings you good luck in your wealth generation abilities. You
							are always present in any social gathering for the genuine purpose of creating lasting
							relationships.
						</p>
						<p>
							The last thing you worry about is being put on the center stage because you know your selfworth and you have a good way with words.
						</p>
						<p>
							This can be your sole energy and motivation to do a particular thing and grab that opportunity at
							the door.
						</p>
						<p>
							Influencers would rather worry about letting these good chances slip and take time preparing
							their physical appearance before they show up in a room.

								THESE WONDERFUL GIFTS, HOWEVER, ARE BEING

								You being dependent on other money for your happiness does more harm to you. Your desire

							<p>
								The reason for this is rooted in something that you are never expecting. In reality, the reason is
								more than the fact that these material stuff are something that will make your life comfortable.
								Caring a lot about material things is something that you should address right away.
							</p>
							<p>
								You find it hard to trust people to help you with insecurities. You are never okay sharing your
								problems with anyone but yourself.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								And this might be a reason why your own timeline to achieve your life goals is taking a little too
								long than expected.
							</p>
							<p>
								True enough, your social capabilities may seem fine. It can generate you income, and it can
								afford the lifestyle you want. But that is only for now, the world is changing and you have to
								muster the courage to get out of your comfort zone, particularly that reason why you have

							</p> 
							<p>
								This is your greatest source of obstacles that constantly brings you problems with regards to

								In fact, I’m seeing that this negative energy still continues as we go along so...

								BEWARE OF THESE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS I’VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH
								SUCH WONDERFUL GIFTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED								
							</h2>
							<p>
								Influencers find it hard to let go of the material things that they think are making them happy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your tendency to become financially dependent on others is a big factor on why you have not
								attained financial freedom and independence yet.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your shine and self-confidence are not going to be there forever. Your bad money habits will put
								these natural gifts of yours into shame.
							</p>
							<p>
								Influencers are prone to suffer from lack of financial independence in the future because they
								failed to realize that they’ve been viewing life from a wrong perspective heading towards the
								wrong direction.

								DON’T TAKE THESE OBSTACLES FOR GRANTED.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Your gifts are being utilized at its minimal. Your greatest weaknesses are slowly taking over 
								your potential hence, achieving your goals are taking so much time for now.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your anxious mind makes it hard for you to find that happiness you’ve always yearned for in
								your career, lifestyle, relationships, and wealth.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-influencer text-center">
								Your timeline to achieve your goals are getting more and more

								In Science, we have always learned that energy balance is important. Consuming too
								much energy and burning too little of it would result to the storage of body fat - and this
								will lead to risks of diseases and organ malfunction in the long run.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, let’s apply the same to our mind’s composition.
							</p>
							<p>
								A positive energy is not enough to bring you tremendous results and abundance.
								Possessing your own gifts and strengths are not enough.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes, too much of this strength can lead to negative consequences.
							</p>
							<p>
								Too much of the negative energy will then open the gates to unforeseen events and
								result to your goals getting delayed.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the same principle that celebrities and wealthy businessmen have been using for
								years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just like you, they only uncovered this at some point in their lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								They only uncovered it at some point where the negative energy they didn’t know
								they’ve been possessing was taking so much control in their lives that their goals turned
								seemingly hard to achieve.

							<h2 class="sub-header-influencer text-center">
								Psychologists say that our financial decisions, including the unintelligent ones,
								are affected by the subconsciousness
							</h2>
							<p>
								This subconscious is seated on the deepest part of the mind - that which is not brought
								by experiences, but is generally inherited.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is responsible for one’s belief, spirituality, and instincts.
							</p>
							<p>
								That subconsciousness can be understood and defined by these archetypes which can
								tell patterns of behaviour and mindset.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first thing that mega-wealthy who found this revelation did was to become aware of
								their wealth archetype. From then on, they became aware of their behaviours, instinct,
								and patterns. They found the source of their negative
								and patterns. They found the source of their negative
								energies and became much more prepared to deal with the possible problems they are
								the most prone to encounter.
							</p>
							<p>
								This knowledge became one of their ultimate weapons to transcend the challenges
								coming to their way.

								Attaining finances gruelling like an uphill climb, yet disappearing like sand through your fingertips when you do get them.

								A burning frustration because the goalpost keeps moving, where the fulfilment of your dreams seem to be further and further away.

								You may be wondering, <strong><i>is it because I’m not trying hard enough?</i></strong>

							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								Well, the answer is a resounding no.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Listen... It has nothing to do with your efforts. <i>Not at all.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								The main reason you're not manifesting the way you’re supposed to is because <strong>of this STARTLING stumbling block.</strong> 
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s actually the hidden reason behind the stark inequality in this world.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, while I admit circumstances are volatile at the moment... This 1 thing even can cause you to REMAIN poor even when times are good.

							<p>
								You see... Your struggle with money didn’t just start with you.
							</p>
							<p>
								It began many generations ago.
							</p>
							<p>
								Science has shown that any form of trauma -- be it finances, abuse, war or other unpleasant things -- actually affects you on a genetic level.
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								It’s named epigenetics.
							</h2>
							<p>
								Epigenetics is the study of how prior behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a sobering study published by the Society of Biological Psychiatry in November 2020, it concluded that if your ancestors encounter trauma like extreme poverty, the brain chemistry of the baby will be adversely affected.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, your mind can’t reach it’s full manifestation potential because the brain has been “handicapped” since birth.
							</p>
							<p>
								So if you’re fighting to make ends meet... It’s probably because your ancestors faced the same issue... And now you <strong>have a historical handicap.</strong>  
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								Here’s an illustration.

							<p>
								You may teach an arthritic patient all the steps to a specific ballroom dance... However, no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to replicate the steps properly. In fact, they may not be even able to replicate the steps at all.

								You exert the energy... Try all you may... And then...

								When you say, “that person is blessed with good genes”... You hit the nail on the head!
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything they touch turns to gold, like King Midas.
							</p>
							<p>
								In an explosive 2011 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology, children who are brought up in affluent or poverty-stricken homes affect the epigenetics of their DNA.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can <strong>dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>Pay attention because that statement holds the key to your breakthrough.</i></strong>
							</p>

								In another study... Rich kids are naturally inclined to assert their will in life, whereas poor kids tend to shrink away in servitude.

							</p>
							<p>
								From Genetic Glass Ceiling to Genetic Jackpot!
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m going to repeat an earlier passage which holds the remarkable key.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong><i>“Children in rich and poor households have similar sets of genes, but their environment can dictate which genes are switched on or silenced.”</i></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, you’re born with <strong>the innate potential</strong> within you... It’s just switched off.
							</p>
							<p>
								The studies reveal poverty and abundance is really a difference of triggering the “on” switch for certain genetics.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>So How Do We Do That?</strong>
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								I Present to You “the Genetic Wealth Switch”
							</h2>
							<p>
								<strong>In other words, You Play Specific Frequencies That Turn On the Genes to Make Wealth</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								That may sound strange, but it's cutting edge science.  

								According to a revolutionary 2018 Kyoto University study in ScienceDaily... When mechanosensitive genes are subjected to audible sounds, the genes can actually be switched on or off.

								In layman terms, certain frequencies awaken the cells that spark abundance.

								When you tune in to these near-magic frequencies...

								Even the most irreversible of circumstances can change. Where hearts start opening up... When messages from the Universe become more vivid...
