                    It&rsquo;s not too late yet to remedy your negative vibrations (weaknesses) to counter the possible problems that a natural Banker would eventually encounter in this lifetime.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment.

        <p class="p-style-guide">
            These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want to watch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It&rsquo;s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you.
