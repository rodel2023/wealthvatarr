							<p>It&rsquo;s not too late yet to remedy your negative vibrations (weaknesses) to counter the possible problems that a natural Banker would eventually encounter in this lifetime. </p>

							<p>Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment. </p>

							<p>These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want to watch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance. </p>

							<p>However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It&rsquo;s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you. </p>

							<p>Here are the solutions catered just for a Banker like you:</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								#1 Start Investing In Short-Term Investments
							</h2>

							<p>Letting your money sit in the bank is good. After all it still earns interest in your savings account. However, that alone as an investment will not realistically provide enough money to fund these wants of yours. </p>

							<p><strong>Why Short-Term Investments?</strong> </p>

							<ul>
								<li>It&rsquo;s beginner-friendly. Investors now earning 7-figures from their diverse portfolio started with short-term investments. </li>
								<li>It is associated with lower risk. Short-term investments can be converted into cash within 5 years. </li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>What Are The Best Short-Term Investments?</strong> </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Savings Accounts </li>
								<li>Money Market Account </li>
								<li>Short-Term Bond Funds </li>
								<li>Bank Certificates of Deposits </li>
								<li>Peer-to-peer Loans</li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Where To Avail?</strong> </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Banks in your locality offer short-term investments. Most of them would offer to do the work for you such as enrolling your funds into different short-term funds and assets you prefer.&nbsp;</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								#2 When You Are Able To Take It To The Next Level, Invest In Long-Term Ones
							</h2>

							<p>Long-term investments are those where you let your money stay for a long time to generate cash after a certain number of years. Do this when you are ready to part with some of your money and put it in an income-generating fund to leave it there for maximum returns. </p>

							<p><strong>Why Long-Term Investments?</strong> </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Less time-consuming. You won&rsquo;t need to be bothered by the fluctuations of the value of the asset. </li>
								<li>Higher returns of investment. </li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>What Are The Best Long-Term Investments?</strong> </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Stocks </li>
								<li>Corporate and Treasury Bonds </li>
								<li>Mutual Funds </li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Where To Avail?</strong> </p>

							<p>Mutual Funds are offered by banks as well. As your local bank about their own investment fund managed by experts that are expected to yield huge returns after sometime. The good thing about this is that you don&rsquo;t need to learn the in-depths of stock trading because the experts will handle it for you. Unit Investment Trust or mutual funds managed by some retail banks require a minimum investment of $500. </p>

							<p>There are also online brokers and trading platforms which offer $0 fees and no minimum amount. You would only need to deposit such amount enough to buy a minimum number of stocks in your preferred company.</p>

							<h2 class="sub-header-banker text-center">
								#3 Start A Side Hustle
							</h2>

							<p>A Banker is always hesitant to spend money on things they are not sure about. However, there are successful online businesses and side hustles which can be started with little to no capital at all! </p>

							<p>Here are the best low-cost side hustles for you and the average salary you can earn as a passive income: </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Sell online courses (Minimum $50 per course) </li>
								<li>Writing and content creation services (Minimum $10 per article for web content) </li>
								<li>Blogger / Affiliate Marketer ($200/month for a beginner)</li>
