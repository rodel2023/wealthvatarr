							<p> 
								The Capitalist loves big and risky assets. They play the get-rich-quick game no matter how big
								the involved money is. Just like a rebel, a Capitalist loves challenging the norms by their
								creative ideas. They have their own ways of doing things and they love the track that‟s not being
								used by many.
							</p>
							<p>     
								They are the best person to ask about financial complexities. Numbers are their friends, but
								sometimes, a Capitalist bravely takes on a challenge even without enough data and backup
								plan. When they win, they win big. But when they lose, they lose a lot.
								You have your own set of approaches and practices when it comes to risk-taking and creativity.
								This attitude is what makes you unstoppable from pursuing the things you want.
								In short, you believe that your long-term goals can be easily achieved by taking the road less
								traveled.

							<p><u><strong>Why do I need to identify my superpowers and strengths?</strong></u></p>
							<p>Good question. Let‟s start with knowing the importance of superpowers and strengths. First of all, research has already shown that there are certain qualities that ancient humans have evolved overtime to resist extreme weather and endure stress. These amazing traits are what made humans stand the attack of nature and made them thrive in extreme situations. Research further concluded that these skills and abilities can still be further developed according to one‟s limits.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>The same goes to one‟s inner traits.</strong></p>
							<p> One‟s superpowers are said to be the easiest ones to develop further &ndash; and these developedsuperpowers would be your fastest way to grow your wealth and cultivate a success mindset. As THE CAPITALIST, here are the superpowers which you can focus on to build your first wealth base:</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>Your Risk-Taking Attitude Keeps You On Track</strong></p>
							<p>A Capitalist usually has his long-term and short-term goals completely and clearly laid out in front of him &ndash; and this is the reason why he takes on every challenge no matter how risky it may get. Your favorite line is similar to &ldquo;Let‟s see what happens&rdquo; because your own way of getting the things you want is different from the norms. You place the highest bets on the unconventional ways of building your wealth. This is so that when you win, you know you will win big time and that‟s equivalent to one goal slashed as achieved from your bucketlist.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>You Never Quit</strong></p>
							<p>A Capitalist is always on experimental mode. They are constantly looking for new ways to earn and generative passive income. They may quit a strategy, but their creative and risk-taking mind will just constantly look for another way to compensate the loss in that particular strategy. Quitting is the last option, because on the mind of a capitalist, the world has never-ending ideas. They always aspire to see their ideas come to life and take the responsibility of doing so.</p>

							<br /><p><strong>You Are Fond Of Developing Cutting Edge Ideas</strong></p>
							<p>A Capitalist is a great unconventional entrepreneur, because they always make sure that their offers appeal to the consumers. They develop products and services with the thought in mind that this is going to be the next big thing. Capitalists Understand Financial Complexities They know how others play the money game. They never miss a cent from their financial statements. They are very well-versed with numbers that they know how to play with it. That‟s why they invest in risky and expensive investments &ndash; such as acquiring big assets &ndash; because they know the return can double and triple in the next few years.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>Responsible Gambler</strong></p>
							<p> A Capitalist is a lone figure. This may be a downside because he only works as a one-man team, however, this makes him a responsible person when it comes to mistakes and other liabilities.</p>

							<p><strong>You Find It Hard To Trust People</strong><br /><br />
							A Capitalist does not really feel comfortable when they entrust a big project or a big deadline to people other than themselves. Their trust issues might have been rooted from their childhood or past relationship and friendship betrayals which led them to their fall.</p>

							<p>Capitalists cannot delegate significant work, because of this fear of sabotage. Besides, you think that your own creative ways can bring the best results and only you could do it the way you wanted it to be.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>Capitalists Rarely Have A Backup Plan</strong><br /><br />
							Capitalists have in mind that they will never fail, hence, they take every risk they know of. However, practicality and today‟s uncertainty necessitate the need for a backup plan. When the pandemic kicks in, a lot of thriving businesses were forced to shut down without hint of return. Managers and executives were forced to look for other jobs, media personalities and celebrities started looking for better jobs somewhere. Even the rich are asking their financial managers and advisors of the best thing to do when their investment plummets as the economy is constantly falling.</p>

							<p>If a you are someone who bet a huge stake on something in danger getting dissipated because of this unforeseen event which are claiming lives and livelihoods, then chances are high that you are one of the most uncomfortable people every time the Government imposes new regulations invoking their police power for public safety.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>They Gamble Even Their Whole Financial Security</strong><br /><br />
							Capitalists purchase risky big assets to take control. A Capitalist with no backup plan gambles his or her whole financial stability. A risky appetite, paired with willingness to gamble everything is a very dangerous venture that anyone should be wary of.</p>

							<p>Take for example the story of Patricia Kluge.</p>

							<p>After getting a high-settlement divorce from a wealthy husband, Kluge invested so much of her money by opening a winery and investing into real estate. When the housing market crashed, she lost everything she invested. The bank foreclosed her winery and subdivision. She battled these cases with attorneys around the world to try and save her business ventures. She ended up filing bankruptcy and auctioning off her jewelry and luxurious assets.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>Capitalists Live For The Approval Of Others</strong><br /><br />
							Capitalists are also said ask others for other‟s approval. They love to give attention to money because it makes them stand out from the crowd. A capitalist strives to make a name for him or herself. They want people to see that their method of dealing with things are superior than that of the conventional standards.</p>

							<p><u><strong>These problems can impact your wealth generation potential. Why is that so?</strong></u></p>
							<p><br />

							<strong>Start From The Tried And Tested Systems That You&rsquo;re Already Accustomed To</strong></p>
							<p>
							Grant Cordone, an international sales expert and speaker who now owns multi-million dollar real estate, shared that building your first wealth should come from something that you‟re already familiar with. His video guy started expanding his advertising job to those connected to Cordone and that he did not &ldquo;start a doughnut shop&rdquo; to get multiple streams of income. Cordone calls this symbiotic flows and warned that adding disconnected flows may not work in providing you with better wealth.</p>

							<p><br />
							<strong>Building Wealth Is A Team Effort</strong></p>
							<p> No person became rich without a team backing him or her up. Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and his childhood friend Paul Allen. In 1976, Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Mark Zuckerberg was helped by his classmates in creating and launching FaceMash &ndash; which would later on become Facebook.</p>
							<p>Don‟t be mistaken that a team means a group of professionals working together towards one goal. That is one definition. But remember that you have your very own team at home &ndash; your spouse, parents, siblings, best friends, and trusted relatives. In fact, a team player does not have much qualifications. As long as you are working together in unity and with one goal, you are already considered a team.</p>
							<p>Building wealth is rarely a one-man job. Even if you‟re only investing, you would need financial planners and managers or a stockbroker to trade. Both of you are considered a team with a single goal &ndash; to multiply your money.</p>
							<p>Each people is gifted with a unique sets of gifts &ndash; a set of talents which will eventually fit in your path to success.</p>
							<p>Business- and organization-wise, proper delegation is one of the skills of a good leader. He knows who trust with confidential matters, who would be the best person to do a certain task, and who would be the one who would bring significant and innovative results to the team. Team effort is a work in itself.</p>

							<p>It‟s not too late yet to remedy your negative vibrations (weaknesses) to counter the possible problems that a natural Capitalist would eventually encounter in this lifetime.</p>
							<p>Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment.</p>
							<p>These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want towatch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance.</p>
							<p>However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It‟s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you.</p>
							<p>Here are the solutions catered just for a Capitalist like you:</p>
							
							<p><br /><strong>#1 Enlist The Help Of A Finance Coach / Financial Advisor</strong></p>
							<p><br />Financial coaches aim to help their clients get clear about their financial goals, habits, and money appetite. They teach people how to be responsible with their money and fix their financial practices. An advisor, on the other hand, will recommend investment according to your risk appetite, long-term goals, and amount of money you‟re willing to gamble. A financial professional is not only for the wealthy people &ndash; these professionals cater to small businesses and those with day job who are looking to start or diversify their investment portfolio.</p>
							<p>Wealth management and investment involves risks. Specific investment strategies and the amount to be involved depends particularly on the client. This is a case-to-case basis. Financial advisors provide their clients with individual plans to cater to their needs and specific goals.</p>
							<p>Whether it be a question on the best thing to do with your money just sitting in a bank, an advice about a particular investment, or a help in budgeting a big expensive event such as wedding and birthdays, a financial coach or advisor can provide you the best options to consider.</p>
							<p>Where to find financial coaches / advisors?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Referrals will be your best option if you have friends or colleagues who have tried their</li>
								<li>service.</li>
								<li>Most financial advisors are affiliated with insurance companies.</li>
								<li>National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) website</li>
								<li>Accredited Financial Counselor website</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Alternative: <strong>Start Subscribing To Financial Newsletters And Listening To Financial Podcasts</strong></p>
							<p>Financial podcasts are one of the top podcast niche nowadays. Most people, even the younger generations, are worried of their financial security this pandemic. A finance professional advice may be something that they cannot afford yet, so they resort to financial podcasts to get particular advice from.</p>

							<p><br /><strong>#2 When You Are Able To Take It To The Next Level, Invest In Long-Term Ones</strong><br /><br />
							Long-term investments are those where you let your money stay for a long time to generate cash after a certain number of years. Do this when you are ready to part with some of your money and put it in an income-generating fund to leave it there for maximum returns.</p>
							<p>Why Long-Term Investments?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Less time-consuming. You won‟t need to be bothered by the fluctuations of the value of the asset.</li>
								<li>Higher returns of investment.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>What Are The Best Long-Term Investments?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Stocks</li>
								<li>Corporate and Treasury Bonds</li>
								<li>Mutual Funds</li>
							</ul>

							<p><br />Where To Avail?</p>
							<p>Mutual Funds are offered by banks as well. As your local bank about their own investment fund managed by experts that are expected to yield huge returns after sometime. The good thing about this is that you don‟t need to learn the in-depths of stock trading because the experts will handle it for you. Unit Investment Trust or mutual funds managed by some retail banks require a&nbsp; minimum investment of $500.</p>
							<p>There are also online brokers and trading platforms which offer $0 fees and no minimum amount. You would only need to deposit such amount enough to buy a minimum number of stocks in your preferred company.</p>
							<p><br /><strong>#3 Start A Connected Side Hustle</strong><br /><br />
							Here are the best low-cost side hustles for a Capitalist to fit on his or her expertise:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Sell online courses (Minimum $50 per course)</strong></li>
								<li><strong>Writing and content creation services (Minimum $10 per article for web content)</strong></li>
								<li><strong>Blogger / Affiliate Marketer ($200/month for a beginner)</strong></li>
							</ul>

								<h3>“This path to success is slowly unveiling itself in front of me...I mean, everything is making sense now!”</h3>
								<p>I never knew I've been doing something wrong in my life, until my wealth archetype reading specifically pointed out this certain unconscious thing that's draining me day by day! I never really intended to purchase the whole package because hey it's just the same as every other quiz on the internet.But I'm telling you now - this one surprisingly made an exact reading of my personality when they sent me the free version. 
									(If you think your free reading eerily matches something about you, that's a good start!)
									And the paid version takes things to a whole new level!
									I've never come across such a very specific reading that takes into consideration all my fears and priorities in life, then aligns them all towards my own path to success.
									This path to success is slowly unveiling itself in front of me...I mean, everything is making sense now! The reading itself provided the step-by-step process!
									My life has taken a complete 180 degrees turn after I took the premium offer and understood everything about my wealth archetype. I don't know what kind of sorcery the team has for this one, but after just two months of using their tailored resources, I got a 1.5x pay raise at work and now my life is 100% clearer than before!

								<h3>“This wealth archetype reading will INTERPRET your own fate for you!”</h3>
								<p>
									Perhaps, the best thing I've ever done this year so far is to avail the comprehensive version of this wealth archetype profile.

									Other readings on the internet and fortune-teller wanna-bes will give you poetic and metaphorical results. 

									But this wealth archetype reading will INTERPRET your own fate for you! 

									They even have a clear goal you should follow if you want that next bunch of dollars in your account. (Which makes sense in every angle you look at!) 

									Wealth breakthroughs are something that you start on your own, on your free will. However, you need something to push you to start that. This archetype reading has certainly done its part to compel me to take my first step towards my own breakthrough.

									Challenges still come now and then but the reading also made me realize the stuff I need to weave my way through these problems with the effective formula the reading provided just for me.

									This is the first time I listened to the wealth archetype beats (that's included in your comprehensive package) and boy it works every single time I listen to it. The instructions are clear on how to effectively use them - in just 3 weeks of listening, I attracted the biggest deal in my company till date!

									This is an answered prayer. I personally reached out and thank the creator for sending me this through email!

								<h3>“I will be forever grateful for the people behind this wealth avatar”</h3>
								<p>I’m a real estate specialist and I am a living proof that this reading made me go beyond my sales quota for this month! 

									It’s the first time for me and I will be forever grateful for the people behind this wealth avatar. I’m not sure if someone behind this system is coaching me real time indeed. The guidelines that the reading provided me matches my personality accurately, without disregarding my insecurities. 

									In turn, this reading taught me how to grasp my client’s personalities, too. I’ve never been this good at connecting with clients very well. 

									This reading made me realize that I need to utilize my strengths. But you won’t do that without knowing what they are in the first place. The formula the reading gave me became my day-to-day mantra to push myself to become the better version of myself. 

									I purchased the add-on bonus ‘Morning Ritual’ on top of this wealth avatar comprehensive reading. One client commented how I manage to get so lively no matter what the time is. 

									I’m keeping this on my phone from now on!

								<h3>“You will know EXACTLY how you can get through all the challenges that life throws at you. Definitely life-changing!”</h3>
								<p>
									First time I was commended by my boss for a rush project well done just this week. Done by simply reminding myself the pieces of advice this WealthAvatarr™ premium  report imparted to me. 

									This comprehensive reading was very accurate in pointing out what my weakness is, and what EXACTLY I need to do to rectify it! I guess that’s what sets this one apart from all the boring personality quizzes and coaches out there. 

									This will not only make your bank and your pockets wealthier. Expect to get coached about making yourself happier emotionally, acquainting with the right people, and strengthening your relationships with your friends and loved ones. 

									Mind you, this will not solve all your problems at once but reading through the pages of my comprehensive reading, you will know EXACTLY how you can get through all the challenges that life throws at you. Definitely life-changing!

							<p>
								This is one of those watershed moments in your life. Three paths lie before you:
							</p>
							
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								1) You Can Bury Your Head in the Sand
							</h2>
							<p>
								Look, let me level with you.
							</p>
							<p>
								You’ll know deep down that the job you hate isn’t magically going to transform into the gig of your dreams. That marriage is not going to fix itself. The money issues are not just going away.
							</p>
							<p>
								So if you were intent on making a change, why not plunge in now?
							</p>
							<p>
								With the “Miracle Headphones” Guarantee, what do you have to lose?
							</p>
							<p>
								Alternatively…
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								2) You Can Try to Figure All This Out On Your Own
							</h2>
							<p>
								Really…
							</p>
							<p>
								Just Google “wealth creation” and you’ll get a FLOOD of information.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, you could literally drown in all that conflicting advice.
							</p>
							<p>
								And remember what I said about all the other methods?
							</p>
							<p>
								If it’s man-made, it has limited capability for change. If it taps into nature, your reality will change instantly.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the flip side….
							</p>
							<p>
								This is where…
							</p>
							<h2 class="sub-header-salesperson text-center">
								3) You Can FINALLY Take Control of Your Life!
							</h2>
							<p>
								Look… you’ve already experienced what trouble feels like. The turmoil... The storms of life.
							</p>
							<p>
								You’ve been there… you somewhat survived.
							</p>
							<p>
								But, it’s time to try something different.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Now’s The Time To Say “YES…”</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								“YES” to the amazing gifts just waiting for you to claim and bring into your reality.
							</p>
							<p>
								We’re here on this planet to experience love, joy, and abundance, and now you can experience it all… just by clicking “play.”
							</p>
							<p>
								In just a matter of minutes, the miracle tune will start working its magic and you can finally start attracting wealth specific to your archetype.

								<h3>“I got a sudden influx of orders and new customers for my new shop!”</h3>
								<p>
									I never knew I had this millionaire potential in me until this reading pointed it out!
									I’m a business startup and I can say that this avatar brought my very first good luck. My first niche was not working and way below my expectations but thanks to this package I was able to see where the problem was! 
									Sometimes, it’s not just courage that you need to get out of what you thought would be your breakthrough. It’s courage paired with motivation and the right guidance that will bring you to where you will flourish. This reading is that guidance that will lead you to the outcome you’ve been expecting all along. In fact, it’s even better than what you think. 
									After heeding the advice and implementing it for a week, I got a sudden influx of orders and new customers for my new shop! I think it was the wealth archetype beats (this one comes with the reading) and the add-on bonus guide that made it all possible. 
									I also availed of the Mind Reset secret from the add-ons. I read it before immersing myself with the wealth-archetype beats that come with the comprehensive reading. It works like magic! I woke up with a renewed sense of energy and purpose since then.

								  <dt>What I like about the trending wealth avatar: </dt>
								  <dd>- It tells you about your wealth profile (Are you the spending type? The materialistic person? Or the boss kind?) </dd>
								  <dd>- Your wealth profile is connected with your strength. The reading will guide you how to bank on these strengths of yours.</dd>
								  <dd>- The reading will tell you how to manage and rectify these weaknesses of yours. What makes this special is that it will not tell you general what-to-dos. The reading is very specific. Trust me on this one.</dd>
								  <dd>- The wealth archetype beats work wonders!!! I never once felt groggy anymore after this. </dd>
								  <dd>- The archetype beats are for FREE</dd>
								  <dd>- The added bonus SOLOPRENEUR SUCCESS motivated me to finally start my dream business. I’m now on Day 5 of planning :)</dd>
								</dl>
								<p>
									Does the wealth avatar work? DEFINITELY. I feel more energetic in the office, my confidence levels kicking in every day, and my dream business is taking shape. 
									Will I recommend it? 100% YES. The add-on bonuses feature is also worth it!

								<h3>“…like there was a real human coach behind that tells her exactly what to do with her life.”</h3>
								<p>
									I have never found an online quiz that will tell everything I need to know about me until this! 

									I was surprised by the reason behind my materialistic tendencies. All those articles about taming yourself to stop spending are futile if you don’t address the root cause of these tendencies.

									This reading speaks to me on so many levels. There’s a lot to work on myself or I would drain myself while working hard for that million-dollar bank account dream. 

									I was skeptical about the wealth archetype beats at first but after only four days of listening, I started to see small significant progress in my confidence and decision-making skills. I am excited to see where it will take me after a month of listening. 

									I just recommended this to my sister and she, too, was amazed how specific the reading is, like there was a real human coach behind that tells her exactly what to do with her life. 

									This get’s my highest recommendation!

								<h3>“The formula to make me content and happy, emotionally and financially.”</h3>
								<p>
									I’m one of those people who are going through a midlife crisis. 

									I was just scrolling through my emails when I came across this online reading. I was so bored so I gave it a try and purchased the comprehensive package.

									I can say that it was the turning point of my year because the wealth avatar gave me the courage to try something new! I was overwhelmed by the accuracy of my strengths and weaknesses, and how convincing the reading sounds of what I’m missing from my life. 
								</p>
								<dl>
								  <dt>So basically, the wealth avatar provided me the following: </dt>
								  <dd>- What I need to do to earn more money, based on my personality and on what I’m comfortable with. </dd>
								  <dd>- What I have to do to find genuine relationships which I badly need right now.</dd>
								  <dd>- The formula to make me content and happy, emotionally and financially. </dd>
								  <dd>- Suggestions to make your life more exciting and more enjoyable</dd>
								 </dl>
									<p>
										I’m SO GLAD I returned and purchased the premium reading and the add-on bonuses!

								<h3>“The financial problems I thought would be with me forever now seem like an easy thing to resolve… You won’t regret it…”</h3>
								<p>
									For people who are looking to reset their mind, gain a new perspective, and see themselves from another point of view - this wealth avatar is for you!

									I got three things after the avatar assessment: a higher level of confidence to deal with people, a comprehensive guideline to make me richer in a year based on my profile, and a set of mind-boost tracks that works every time you listen to it. 

									The reading interacts with me like a person is typing behind in real-time. I was assessed on my weaknesses that are dragging me down and the strengths that I am taking for granted. 

									The reading taught me to capitalize on these strengths and what I should do to let go of my insecurities. 

									The financial problems I thought would be with me forever now seem like an easy thing to resolve. Who would have thought that I would only need an accurate guideline like this one to help me solve my problems?

									I read this one on a weekend and like the reviews I’ve been reading about this, the wealth archetype beats gave me that energy kick that no caffeine did before!
								
									You won’t regret it!
