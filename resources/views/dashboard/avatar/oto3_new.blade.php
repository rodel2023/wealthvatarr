							<p>During times of emergency, people often debate whether it&#39;s safer to stay in the countryside or in an urban area. However, the answer to this question depends on the nature of the crisis. If there is a pandemic outbreak, residing in a farm in the countryside away from people in the city may be safer. But, if there is a serious food shortage in the city and society has collapsed, farms may become unsafe.</span></p>

							<p>The reason behind the farms becoming unsafe during a food shortage is because everyone knows that food is grown on farms, and that&#39;s where people will head to get food. In any crisis, the places with a higher population density, such as cities and suburban areas, will become more dangerous. This is because people are unpredictable, and you never know who might resort to desperate measures to get what they want.</span></p>

							<p>Despite the risks, urban areas are where many people live and work. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial to have urban survival strategies in place during times of emergency. In this article, we&#39;ll take a look at a few strategies to prevent you from becoming another statistic to the common crimes that take place during emergencies. By being aware of these strategies, you can increase your chances of survival in an urban area during a crisis.</span></p>

							<p><strong>ENSURING HOME SECURITY</strong></span></p>

							<p>Ensuring the safety of your home should be a top priority for any prepper. It&#39;s advisable to seek the services of a professional security consultant to conduct an assessment of your home and provide recommendations on how to enhance your home security. It&#39;s not recommended to attempt to secure your home on your own since most people lack experience in this area, and criminals can be very resourceful.</p>

							<p>To start with, your doors should be sturdy and reinforced. Installing CCTV cameras at different entrances, exits, and blind spots can provide valuable surveillance footage. Motion sensor floodlights that activate when someone is lurking around at night can also be an effective deterrent for criminals. Additionally, a well-trained guard dog can be an excellent addition to your security setup.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to note that hiding spare keys outside your home should be avoided at all costs. Criminals are aware of common hiding places and can easily gain access to your home. By taking the necessary precautions and implementing these security measures, you can ensure that your home remains safe and secure.</p>

							<p> <strong>DEALING WITH STALKERS</strong> </p>

							<p>During disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes, people tend to stay at home and only venture out for essential errands like grocery shopping or visiting hospitals. However, the quietness outside during these times can make people vulnerable to being stalked by criminals looking for an opportunity to strike.</p>

							<p>If you notice someone following or stalking you, it is important not to panic and speed up your pace as this may alert them to your suspicions and cause them to take immediate action to overpower you. Instead, try to walk into a nearby store and ask the staff to call the police. This will help deter the stalker from attacking you and allow the authorities to intervene before any harm is done.</p>

							<p>If there are no stores around, it is essential to be prepared for self-defense. Keep a weapon like pepper spray or a personal alarm in your handbag or pocket and have it ready to use in case of an emergency. It is also important to maintain your composure and not give away that you are aware of being stalked. This will give you the element of surprise if the stalker decides to attack, increasing your chances of defending yourself and staying safe.</p>

							<p> <strong> REMOTE AREAS </strong> </p>

							<p>It is best to minimize your presence in isolated areas as much as possible to reduce the risk of being a target for criminals. Parking lots that have poor lighting or are located in basements can be prime locations for criminals to commit crimes. Even taking a shortcut through a lonely park could be risky if someone is aware of your daily routine. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid these areas and choose well-lit and well-populated routes instead.</span></p>

							<p> <strong> FIREARMS </strong></p>

							<p>Using firearms for self-protection can be one of the best forms of defense, but it can also be the most dangerous. It&#39;s crucial to know how to use them well. When storing firearms at home, it&#39;s important that they&#39;re easily accessible to you, but not to your kids. You should always keep them unloaded.</p>

							<p>If you hear noises in your home in the middle of the night, you should always shout at the intruder and ask them to identify themselves before using your firearm to protect yourself. Firing blindly in the dark could be disastrous. It&#39;s important to avoid accidental shootings that could occur because of panic or being too quick to use your firearm. It&#39;s best to get proper training to know how to handle firearms safely and effectively.</p>

							<p> <strong> AUTOMOBILES </strong></p>

							<p>To ensure your safety during a crisis, it is crucial to have a well-maintained vehicle with sufficient fuel. You never know when you may need to make a quick trip or evacuate. Transportation is essential during times of emergency. However, it is also important to be cautious and vigilant about your safety while using your vehicle. There is always a risk of car-jacking or kidnapping if you are not careful.</p>

							<p>It is recommended to keep your doors locked and windows rolled up while waiting at stoplights. This is particularly important for women who may be more vulnerable to such situations. It is best to avoid entertaining strangers who try to engage you when you are out late at night. If you feel unsafe, be prepared to hit the gas and make a quick escape.</p>

							<p>It is essential to keep these safety tips in mind at all times. During desperate times, people may resort to desperate measures, and there is no telling what a stranger might do if they have ill-intent. It is not paranoia but a survival instinct to stay alert and prepared for any unexpected situations.<br />

							<p>The year 2020 began with high hopes and expectations, not only because it was a new year but also a new decade. People all over the world had great optimism, thinking that something new and exciting was coming. However, little did anyone know that a new disease discovered in China would quickly spread worldwide, turning the year into a global pandemic.</p>

							<p>For those in the prepping and survival community, COVID-19 is considered a TEOTWAWKI event. This stands for &ldquo;The End of the World as We Know it.&rdquo; However, this doesn&#39;t mean that the world has come to an end, but rather that the world we now live in is different from the one we knew before. The pandemic has caused nationwide lockdowns, businesses to shut down, and people to stay at home, something that would have been unimaginable in the past.</p>

							<p>The old normal is no more, and people are now searching for the &quot;new normal.&quot; Will wearing masks and social distancing become a part of everyday life? Will more people work from home, and will online shopping replace brick-and-mortar stores? Will homeschooling become more common than traditional public schools?</p>

							<p>These and many other questions define this new normal. It&#39;s not just up to one person or committee to answer them, but it&#39;s about how society adapts to the situation that COVID-19 has created. However, one thing is certain, and that is that the world has already changed, and it will continue to change in the future.</p>

							<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a sudden realization among the general population of the importance of survival preparedness. The group known as &ldquo;preppers&rdquo; used to be viewed as paranoid and fringe, but now they are seen as the most forward-thinking individuals on the planet. People who once laughed at the idea of preppers are now waiting in long lines at grocery stores, hoping to buy food, water, cleaning supplies, and toilet paper to build their own stockpiles.</p>

							<p>The pandemic has caused a global shortage of critical personal protective equipment such as medical masks and gloves. Retailers have set their stocks aside for medical personnel, who need them the most, leaving the general population without adequate protection. However, shortages have not been limited to PPE, as grocery store shelves have become bare of certain categories of food, medical and cleaning supplies, and even toilet paper. The shortage of toilet paper, in particular, has left many people wondering how it could have happened.</p>

							<p>As the pandemic continues, people are realizing that they need to be more self-sufficient and prepared for emergencies. The ability to provide for oneself and one&#39;s family during times of crisis is no longer considered paranoid or extreme. It has become a necessity. The importance of having a well-stocked pantry, a supply of clean water, and other essential items is now apparent to all. The pandemic has shown that disasters can strike at any time and that everyone needs to be prepared to face them.</p>

							<p>The importance of emergency preparedness has been highlighted by the Coronavirus pandemic. This is a need that modern society has largely lost, even though our ancestors through the centuries lived that way. If we go back a century, agriculture wasn&#39;t the industrialized version we have today. Rather, it was small family-owned and operated farms. The crops that were planted every year were hoped to be harvested before the first fall freeze so that there would be food to survive the winter. Without a good harvest, survival was questionable. We have become far removed from that in modern society and often don&#39;t even recognize where the things we need come from.</p>

							<p>The pandemic has forced people to recognize the importance of emergency preparedness. Modern society has largely lost this need, and we have become far removed from our agricultural roots. A century ago, small family-owned and operated farms grew foodstuffs to feed their local population. In those times, a good harvest was critical to survival. Unfortunately, people have become complacent and don&#39;t realize where the things they need come from. There are even those who believe that meat comes from the grocery store without any animals being killed to produce it. However, if the grocery stores and restaurants suddenly shut down, they wouldn&#39;t have any idea where to come up with food to eat.</p>

							<p>The society we live in has insulated us from the basic necessities of survival, but that does not mean that those necessities will always be available. Despite our sophisticated technology, we cannot control the weather or guarantee the availability of resources. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of our supply chains. A mere scare of the disease was enough to empty grocery store shelves and meat departments. As many meatpacking plants shut down due to the disease, it is yet to be seen if there will be a second run on meat.</p>

							<p>Life is fragile, and the systems we put in place to protect ourselves are fragile too. The tsunami that hit northeastern Japan in 2011 and Hurricane Harvey that flooded Houston in 2017 are examples of how quickly disasters can destroy entire cities and displace thousands of people. Polite society may appear civilized, but that does not make the world itself civilized or guarantee that everyone in the world is civilized. There are still people who are ready to take advantage of disasters to prey on their fellow humans.</p>

							<p>Despite our modern advancements, we must remember that our ancestors understood the importance of being prepared for emergencies. They lived in small, family-owned farms and grew foodstuffs to feed their local populations. Farmers planted their crops each year, hoping to get them in before the first fall freeze, so that there would be enough food to survive the winter. Today, many people do not even know where their food comes from, and some even believe that meat comes from the grocery store without any animals being killed.</p>

							<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness of the need to be prepared for emergencies, but it should not take a crisis for us to recognize the fragility of life and the world we live in. We cannot control everything, but we can take steps to be ready for disasters and ensure that we have the basic necessities of survival.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE PREPARED</strong></p>

							<p>When it comes to the question of &ldquo;Why is it important to be prepared?&rdquo; some might wonder why it&rsquo;s necessary to do so. However, given the many dangers present in the world, it&rsquo;s almost incredulous not to prepare for disasters. But, for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s answer their question.</p>

							<p>No matter where you live in the world, there is danger present. Even if we exclude the danger caused by criminals and other unsavory characters, there&rsquo;s always the risk of natural disasters. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t live in an area that&rsquo;s prone to hurricanes, but there are probably tornadoes, earthquakes, or winter blizzards to worry about. Just because you don&rsquo;t face the same kind of danger that someone else does, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re immune to disasters.</p>

							<p>Statistically speaking, the average person will go through some type of disaster every eight years, whether it&rsquo;s a natural disaster, a regional disaster, a financial disaster, or a personal disaster. That means that each of us could face anywhere from five to ten disasters in our lifetime.</p>

							<p>Most of us simply try to make do as best we can during disasters, suffering through them as they come. In some cases, government bailouts and non-profit organizations can offer aid. But regardless of the help available, those who are living through the disaster suffer loss - often much more than they can hope to regain.</p>

							<p>The idea of FEMA bailing out people in the event of a disaster is a misguided one. The agency has a poor track record, as evidenced by their performance during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy. Even some cities have turned down FEMA&#39;s offer of help due to their bad reputation. Furthermore, government aid is often hindered by red tape, which slows down the assistance and can have strings attached to it that may result in future payments.</p>

							<p>Additionally, FEMA is not able to provide help quickly enough. The agency advises people to have at least three days&#39; worth of food and water on-hand because they are supposed to have relief in place within 72 hours. However, they often fail to meet that goal. During Hurricane Sandy, they did not even start putting out RFQs (request for quotes) until the day after the hurricane had already hit the New Jersey seashore. This delay can make a huge difference when it comes to saving lives and providing assistance to those in need.</p>

							<p>Given these limitations, it&#39;s clear that relying solely on FEMA is not a viable disaster preparedness plan. Instead, individuals should take responsibility for their own preparedness by stockpiling food, water, and other supplies to last for several days or even weeks. Being self-sufficient during a disaster can not only save lives but can also ease the burden on emergency responders and relief agencies. In short, it&#39;s essential to prepare for disasters rather than relying on outside help that may not come quickly or at all.</p>

							<p>It is important to note that relying on the government to rescue you during emergencies is a relatively recent concept. In fact, FEMA wasn&#39;t established until 1979. Prior to that, individuals were responsible for taking care of themselves and relied on assistance from their communities, such as friends, neighbors, and religious organizations. However, the government, along with other governments worldwide, is making significant efforts to discourage this independent mindset.</p>

							<p>Prepping is about taking control of your life and ensuring your safety during emergencies, rather than relying on the government for assistance. This may seem like a foreign concept in today&#39;s society, but it has been a successful approach for centuries. While some may not have survived, they did not put others at risk to take care of them.</p>

							<p>Deciding how much to prepare is a personal decision, and there are no strict guidelines that must be followed. Some people may suggest certain amounts of food or ammunition, but ultimately, you must decide what works best for you.</p>

							<p>Initially, the idea of prepping may seem overwhelming. There are many tasks to be done, and it can be challenging to know where to start. However, everyone&#39;s preparedness journey is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It&#39;s important to remember that you don&#39;t have to do everything at once, and some things that work for others may not be practical for you.</p>

							<p>Rather than being intimidated, approach prepping as a journey rather than a destination. Every step you take towards preparedness will improve your chances of survival and provide increased security for you and your family. By taking small steps towards preparedness, you&#39;ll feel more in control and confident in your ability to handle any emergency.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>FACING THE RISK</strong></p>

							<p>We all live in a world full of risks, and this reality has existed for as long as humans have. Although the specific risks we face may vary, there are still many that affect us all. The degree to which these risks affect us can also differ depending on our particular situation. It&#39;s essential to ask what these risks are, how severe they are, and how likely they are to happen, so we can make informed decisions about how to prepare for them.</p>

							<p>Breaking it down and analyzing these risks is crucial. It allows us to assess the potential impact of each one and decide which ones are most significant to our lives. This knowledge helps us to identify the appropriate steps to take to protect ourselves and our loved ones. So, it&#39;s important to educate ourselves about the risks and be prepared to face them.</p>

							<p><strong>COPING WITH PERSONAL DISASTERS</strong></p>

							<p>Encountering personal disasters is a universal experience. These are events that impact only us or our family members. They are the most frequent type of disasters that we may encounter, making up more than half of the potential crises we may face in our lives. Personal disasters encompass a variety of events, including the following:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Loss of a job</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Loss of a loved one</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Divorce</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Major accident or illness</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Every personal disaster has an emotional and financial or material aspect. While none of them may qualify as a survival situation, they can be serious enough to cause significant disruptions to our families, particularly if the financial repercussions result in the loss of our home.</p>

							<p>When planning for these scenarios, minimizing the financial impact is critical. We can&#39;t do much to alleviate the emotional impact of losing a loved one, but we can control the expenses associated with the funeral. Decreasing the financial impact not only provides stability and security for our families, but it also lessens the overall emotional impact by avoiding additional stress and problems in addition to the original disaster.</p>

							<p><strong>COPING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS</strong></p>

							<p>No matter where you reside in the world, natural disasters can strike at any moment. The real question is not whether you will face disasters, but rather what type of disasters you will encounter and how severe they will be. You may assume that your area is safe from disasters, but you may be forgetting to account for severe weather events. Disasters can include hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, earthquakes, winter blizzards, thunderstorms, flooding, and tsunamis. These disasters all have emotional and financial implications, but they also include a survival aspect. Each year, people lose their lives to these disasters. But surviving the disaster is only part of the challenge. The aftermath of the disaster is often more difficult to navigate, especially when trying to meet your family&#39;s needs while salvaging and rebuilding your home.</p>

							<p>The good news is that natural disasters usually bring a wave of aid through individuals and non-profit organizations. People provide food, clothing, water, building materials, and even aid in rebuilding your home. However, it is mostly up to you to keep your family alive during the recovery period when life is far from normal. Prepping is more about surviving the aftermath of a disaster than the disaster itself. For instance, a hurricane might last for a day or two, but the time it takes to recover and return to normalcy can take weeks or even months. Without the ability to work during that period or without electricity, you may face difficulties feeding your family and keeping them warm.</p>

							<p><strong>COPING WITH MAJOR DISASTERS</strong></p>

							<p>A disaster that affects a large region is considered a major disaster, and it can be challenging to deal with due to the widespread impact. In such situations, resources are often insufficient to help everyone, and non-profit organizations may find themselves short of funds. Some examples of major disasters include pandemics, financial collapses, events that take down the electrical grid, asteroid impacts, and zombie apocalypses. While governments may attempt to provide aid on a national scale, there can be repercussions such as adding to the national debt. Any of these disasters could lead to a TEOTWAWKI (The End Of The World As We Know It) scenario, requiring long-term survival skills. For example, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack could potentially take down the US electrical grid and cause widespread deaths from starvation and disease. In such a case, being self-sufficient in terms of food, water, and firewood would be crucial for survival.</p>

							<p><strong>EVALUATING RISKS</strong></p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><img src="{{asset('assets/img/image/evaluating_risk.png')}}" style="height:300px; width:626px" /></p>

							<p>When it comes to potential disasters, some can be more problematic than others due to their severity of impact, while others can pose a greater risk due to their likelihood of occurrence. As such, it&#39;s important to assess which disasters should be given priority. This can be achieved by creating a risk matrix that evaluates the likelihood and impact of each potential disaster.</p>

							<p>The risk matrix is a chart with two axes labeled &quot;likelihood&quot; and &quot;impact.&quot; Each potential disaster is rated for both of these factors and placed in the appropriate box on the chart. After evaluating each potential disaster, we can add up the scores for likelihood and impact to determine a total risk score for each item.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to note that the examples given may not be an exhaustive list of potential disasters. The scores for each potential disaster listed in the chart are as follows: EMP - 9, Hurricane - 8, Sickness - 6, Loss of Job - 6, Zombies - 6, Blizzard - 5, Invasion - 5, Death - 4, Pandemic - 4, Blackout - 2.</p>

							<p>By using a risk matrix to evaluate potential disasters, we can better understand which ones pose the greatest risks to us and prepare accordingly.</p>

							<p>The listed disasters have been ordered in descending order, from the highest score to the lowest. The top two disasters in the example are EMP and Hurricane, with EMP having the highest score, followed by Hurricane. It is interesting to note that Hurricane is considered more likely to occur, while the impact of an EMP is believed to be greater.</p>

							<p>While it is important not to overlook any potential disaster on the list (excluding a zombie apocalypse), the focus of our preparedness efforts should be on the disasters with the highest scores, such as an EMP or a hurricane. By doing so, we increase our chances of being prepared for the disasters that we are most likely to encounter.</p>

							<p>An EMP is an excellent disaster to use as a framework for long-term preparedness because it covers almost anything by bringing down our entire infrastructure and supply chain through the electrical grid. However, preparing for an EMP does not necessarily mean that we will be prepared for everything. There are specific requirements for a pandemic that are not covered in an EMP preparedness plan.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PART 1 - HOW TO START</strong></p>

							<p>If you&#39;re new to prepping and reading this book, you&#39;ll likely want to make progress as quickly as possible. This desire is common among those whom I&#39;ve helped. In this section, we&#39;ll cover the basics of what you need to have and do in order to survive. We&#39;ll also discuss the first steps you should take to acquire the necessary equipment and supplies. By completing the tasks outlined in this section, you&#39;ll be ahead of 99% of the population, even those who stockpiled for COVID-19.</p>

							<p>A common issue with people who only stock up for a particular disaster is that they relax and return to normal once the disaster is over. The items they purchased to get through the disaster are used for everyday purposes, and when faced with another potential disaster, they must start all over again. We won&#39;t operate that way. Instead, we&#39;ll gather equipment and build a stockpile that we&#39;ll maintain. This doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;ll never use the food or other items we purchase, but rather that we&#39;ll replace them if we use them.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>WHAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHEN TALKING ABOUT SURVIVAL</strong></p>

							<p>The average teenager may believe that their survival priorities include their smartphone and a latte, but they have a very different idea of what survival truly entails. Many people are unaware of what is essential to keep them alive, as opposed to what makes them happy. It&#39;s important to understand this distinction when discussing survival priorities.</p>

							<p>Survival priorities refer to those items that are necessary to sustain life. The length of time that our bodies can survive without these specific items is a crucial factor. While your teenage daughter may argue that she cannot live without her phone, in reality, she could survive for several years without it. This is something I know from personal experience, having lived over 30 years without one.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s essential to prioritize our true survival needs over what we may consider to be important for our daily happiness. Understanding this distinction can make all the difference in a true survival situation. So, while a latte may provide temporary pleasure, it is not a survival priority. It&#39;s important to focus on the essentials to ensure our survival in any situation.</p>

							<p>Conversely, there are certain necessities such as water and food that are vital for survival and cannot be overlooked. These are the critical items that we need to consider when preparing for emergency situations. As a result, our top four survival priorities are based on these fundamental requirements.</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Oxygen, which we can only live without for about three minutes.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Maintaining our core body heat, which we can only live without for about 30 minutes.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Clean drinking water, which we can only live without for about three days.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Food, which we can only live without for about 30 days.</li>
							</ul>

							

							<p>Upon examination of these numbers, it becomes apparent that they all consist of the digit 3. This concept is referred to as the rule of threes and serves as a helpful tool to recall the top survival priorities and their degree of importance. While the figures may not be precise, they are sufficiently accurate for our purposes. Survival essentially means providing our bodies with these essential necessities. However, oxygen is beyond our control - we either have it or we don&#39;t. If, for example, the planet&#39;s oxygen supply were to suddenly vanish, it would render the other priorities irrelevant; none of us would survive. Despite being our primary survival priorities, they are not the sole factors to consider when discussing survival. There are three additional critical areas that, while not categorized as survival priorities in the same sense, are significant enough that neglecting them could potentially result in fatal consequences. These supplementary priorities are:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Starting a fire &ndash; necessary for warmth, cooking food, and purifying water</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">First-aid &ndash; critical for treating injuries and preventing infections to maintain good health</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Self-defense &ndash; important to protect yourself, family, and resources in case of threats or attacks</li>
							</ul>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>ENSURING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER</strong></p>

							<p>It&#39;s easy to take for granted the abundance of clean water available with a simple turn of a faucet. However, we must remember that without sufficient clean drinking water, we will die quickly. Health experts recommend drinking eight, eight-ounce glasses of water per day, which aligns with the standard survival wisdom of one gallon of clean water per person per day for drinking and cooking.</p>

							<p>However, those who work in the hot sun or engage in physical activity may need considerably more water, as they can quickly sweat out more than a gallon per day. Additionally, water is required for other purposes, such as bathing, washing clothes, and watering vegetable gardens. Although the rest of the water does not have to be biologically clean like the water we drink, it can still be used as grey water.</p>

							<p>Clean water refers to water that is free of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, which cause dysentery and disease. Grey water is used water that is repurposed for other uses, such as watering gardens. In a survival situation, we cannot trust any water source. We must assume that all water is contaminated, including the water from our kitchen faucet, unless we have been explicitly informed by our municipal water authority that it is safe to drink. Flooding and hurricanes can compromise city water systems, and city water may stop flowing, especially if the electrical grid goes down. Therefore, we must have an alternative water source that we can use in case of an emergency.</p>

							

							<p><strong>Where to Locate Water Sources in an Urban Environment</strong></p>

							<p>Having access to multiple sources of water is crucial for survival, considering the significance of water as a top priority. Depending on a single source of water can pose a risk, as it may not be sufficient to fulfill the needs of everyone who requires it. Additionally, some groups may try to claim and control the water source, making it unavailable to others. Therefore, the ideal option is to collect water on your own. This can be achieved by:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Well: Drilling a well may require a permit and is expensive, but it&#39;s the most reliable source of water. Make sure to have a manual pump or solar panels to power the pump.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Rainwater harvesting: Simply add rain barrels under gutters and downspouts to collect rainwater.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Humidity catchers: Works in high humidity areas with enough wind, extract water directly from the air.</li>
							</ul>

							

							<p>It is important to note that even though the water from these sources may seem clean, it still needs to be purified. Rainwater may contain bird droppings as it falls on your roof. In addition to the sources already mentioned, there are usually other water sources in our surroundings that we may not be aware of. Some of these sources may be indicated on a topographical map, which can be found at<a href="http://www.usgs.gov/" style="text-decoration:none"> <span style="color:#1155cc"><u>www.usgs.gov</u></a>. However, it is essential not to limit yourself to this resource alone. Take the time to explore your neighborhood carefully and discover any hidden water sources that may be available to use in a post-disaster scenario. Make sure to mark them on a map with a descriptive legend and keep it in your survival notebook. Look for: Lakes and ponds, Rivers and streams, Canals, Public swimming pools, Public fountains, Large, multi-floor commercial buildings, and Water towers.</p>

							

							<p>To collect and transport the water you find, it&#39;s important to have a method that doesn&#39;t rely on your car. A hand cart, wagon, or hand truck can be used with five-gallon buckets or jugs. Additionally, you&#39;ll need a faucet bib key to access water from commercial buildings and the testing port on water towers.</p>

							<p><strong>How to Purify Your Water</strong></p>

							<p>Ensuring the purity of the water you drink is crucial, no matter the source. With various methods available, it&#39;s recommended to have at least two or more purification options readily accessible.</p>

							<p><strong>Talking About Filtration</strong></p>

							<p>Water treatment plants utilize filtration as well as chemical purification to ensure the safety of drinking water. However, relying solely on filtration to purify water requires a high-quality filtration system. Regular &quot;whole house filters&quot; that eliminate sediment from water are insufficient as they only filter down to 10 microns, while bacteria can range from 0.2 to 2.0 microns, and viruses are even smaller, ranging from 20 to 400 nanometers or 0.02 to 0.4 microns in size.</p>

							<p>Fortunately, there are several excellent filters available in the market specifically designed for the survival community, capable of filtering out 99.99% of bacteria and some viruses. It is essential to carefully review the specifications of any filter you plan to purchase to ensure that it meets your requirements.</p>

							<p>However, filtration as a method of purifying water has a disadvantage in that most filters eventually become clogged. If the filter cartridge cannot be backflushed, it will need to be replaced periodically. Nonetheless, not all filter cartridges are created equal. Some filters can last significantly longer, measured in the number of gallons they purify, than others. Surprisingly, some of the most expensive filter elements can be the most economical to use due to the number of gallons of water they can filter before becoming clogged.</p>

							<p><strong>Talking About Chemical Purification</strong></p>

							<p>Chemical purification is a method of water treatment that involves adding chemicals to the water to kill microorganisms. Chlorine is the most commonly used chemical in water treatment and is used in almost all municipal water processing plants as well as swimming pools. Iodine is also a viable option, but it is more expensive.</p>

							<p>You can easily find chlorine in swimming pool chemicals or in bleach, which is used to whiten clothes. However, it is important to note that you should avoid buying the color safe or scented kinds of bleach. Instead, purchase normal bleach, which has a chlorine content of 5.25% or 6.0%.</p>

							<p>To purify water using chlorine bleach, add eight drops of bleach to a gallon of water and stir. Allow the water to sit for 20 minutes before drinking. If you don&#39;t like the smell of chlorine, let the purified water sit overnight to allow the chlorine to evaporate.</p>

							<p>For larger quantities of water, you can measure the chlorine bleach in cubic centimeters or milliliters. One milliliter is equivalent to 20 drops of bleach, so a five-gallon bucket requires 2 ml of bleach and a 55-gallon drum requires 22 ml of bleach. It is recommended that you treat all stored water in your stockpile to keep it fresh and pure.</p>

							<p><strong>Talking About Heat Purification</strong></p>

							<p>Water can be purified by boiling it, but it is not necessary to bring it to 212&deg;F (100&deg;C). Instead, water can be pasteurized by heating it to 162&deg;F (72&deg;C) for 15 seconds. There is a device called a WAPI (Water Pasteurization Indicator) that can be used to pasteurize water in third-world countries. The WAPI is a plastic capsule with a wax bead inside it that melts at 160&deg;F, indicating that the water is pasteurized. Once removed from the hot water, the wax solidifies, making it possible to reuse the WAPI again and again.</p>

							<p>The best option for heat purification is to make a still. Stills work by bringing the water to the boiling point, so that liquid water turns into steam. The water vapor is then run through a condenser, typically made of copper tubing, where it will cool and return to a liquid state. In this process, everything besides the water gets left behind, including chemicals, minerals, bacteria, salt, and other dissolved solids that do not turn to a vapor at 212&deg;F (100&deg;C).</p>

							<p>Using a still is the only way to convert ocean water to drinkable water. If you live near the seashore, you could have an endless supply of drinkable water in the worst survival situations if you have a still to purify it.</p>

							<p><strong>Building a Water Stockpile for Emergency Situations</strong></p>

							<p>Stockpiling water is essential for surviving disasters, as it may be difficult to find water during an emergency. However, storing enough water for an extended period can be challenging due to space and purity issues. While most homes lack enough storage space, using 55-gallon drums can save space and cost, especially if stored in a basement.</p>

							<p>Blue plastic drums are commonly used for water storage, but they are chemical drums, and their contents may be harmful to human health. To use these drums safely, you must know what was in them previously, and if they contain any poisonous chemicals. Alternatively, white plastic drums are food-grade and require cleaning to remove any food residue. To clean the barrels, use a mixture of water with eight drops of bleach per gallon, let it sit for a minute, and then dump it out. Refill the barrels with water containing eight drops of bleach per gallon to prevent any growth of bacteria.</p>

							<p>For larger water storage, an above-ground swimming pool can be used. The chlorine required for swimming pools can purify the water, making it safe for drinking. A 12-foot diameter pool, 30 inches deep, can hold over 2,000 gallons of water, while a 16-foot diameter pool, 36 inches deep, can hold just over 4,500 gallons. Pools offer a significant advantage over smaller drums as they can store larger amounts of water, but also do not draw attention to the real purpose of the pool.</p>

							<p>In summary, while stockpiling water for extended periods is challenging, it is crucial to prepare for a disaster, as it can be challenging to find water during emergencies. Storing water in 55-gallon drums or above-ground pools is ideal, but it is essential to ensure the purity of the water by cleaning and using chlorine bleach.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>HOW TO PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS</strong></p>

							<p>Proper food storage and supply is a critical component of emergency preparedness. While water is the most essential resource for survival, food is also vital for our body&#39;s sustenance. Without proper nutrition, our bodies can weaken, making it harder to perform necessary survival tasks and increasing susceptibility to diseases.</p>

							<p>On average, an American adult consumes around a ton of food per year, including meals cooked at home and restaurants. However, most people do not consume a healthy diet or the recommended 2,000 calories per day. Many of us can exceed this limit by lunchtime, and some fast-food chains offer supersized meals containing more than 2,000 calories.</p>

							<p>Nutritionists argue that our diet should include micronutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, in addition to macronutrients that are essential for our bodies to function. However, for survival, a diet that is heavy in macronutrients is necessary, and micronutrients can be ignored for at least the first month. After that, it&#39;s crucial to reintroduce them to maintain good health. So, what are these macronutrients?</p>

							<p>Macronutrients are essential nutrients that our bodies need in large quantities to perform necessary functions. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Carbohydrates are the body&#39;s primary source of energy, and we can obtain them from foods such as bread, rice, and fruits.&nbsp;</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Proteins help build and repair tissues, and we can find them in foods such as meat, eggs, and beans.&nbsp;</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fats provide the body with energy, help with the absorption of vitamins, and are found in foods such as nuts, butter, and oils.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>When preparing a survival stockpile, it is important to choose non-perishable food items that do not require refrigeration. This is because power outages are a common occurrence during disasters, making it difficult to keep perishable foods fresh. While it may be tempting to stock up on favorite foods, this is not always practical. Fresh and frozen foods are not suitable for long-term storage without refrigeration, and many junk foods do not provide efficient nutrients.</p>

							<p>Therefore, when creating a survival stockpile, it is best to focus on non-perishable food items that provide essential macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This ensures that you have a supply of food that will provide the necessary energy and building blocks for your body to function properly during a crisis. By choosing foods that do not require refrigeration, you can avoid the risk of spoilage and waste, and ensure that your family has access to healthy, nourishing meals during a disaster.</p>

							<p>Instead of stockpiling fresh or frozen foods, it&#39;s best to choose non-perishable items for survival. The following items are great options to stockpile:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Whole grains for baking</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">White rice</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Dry beans for protein</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Pasta, which can expand any meal</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Spaghetti sauce to flavor dishes</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Canned vegetables and fruits</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Dry fruits</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Nuts and peanut butter for protein</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Jelly to pair with peanut butter</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Baking supplies like baking powder and soda</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Cooking oil</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Powdered milk and eggs for baking</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Dehydrated meat and canned meat</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Bouillon for soup stock</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Spices to add flavor to unusual foods</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Sugar and honey for sweetness</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Coffee for a caffeine boost</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Vitamins for micronutrients</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">TVP (textured vegetable protein) as meat substitutes</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Cheese that has been triple-dipped in wax to preserve it</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Powdered drink concentrates</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Granola and granola bars for quick energy</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Purified water, as it&#39;s important to have plenty of it available.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>To determine how much food you need for your stockpile, it is recommended to create a two-week menu, listing all the items you will need, including ingredients for bread or other baked goods. Combine the lists, tallying up the quantities needed for each item, and multiply that by the number of weeks you want to prepare for to determine how much food to buy.</p>

							<p>When considering how long you want your stockpile to last, it&#39;s important to plan for the worst-case scenario, including the recovery time. For instance, a hurricane may only disrupt your city for a few days, but pandemics like COVID-19 have demonstrated that supply chains can take weeks or even months to recover. Therefore, having enough food to sustain you through the disaster and its aftermath is a good starting point.</p>

							<p>After reaching your initial goal, you may want to continue building your stockpile gradually, aiming for a year&#39;s worth of food. However, this will take time to achieve.</p>

							<p><strong>Long-Term Storage of Food</strong></p>

							<p>Repurposing grocery store food for long-term storage is not as straightforward as one may think. While canned goods are usually packaged for extended shelf-life, dry foods often require repackaging to last longer. Fortunately, there is a method to package them, allowing them to stay edible for 20 years or more.</p>

							<p>Expiration dates on canned goods in metal cans or glass jars can be ignored. These dates do not indicate food spoilage but rather the date until which the canner guarantees that the food retains its nutritional value. The only legal requirement for an expiration date is for baby formula. Canned goods that are decades old have been opened and found to be perfectly safe to consume. However, canned goods in plastic containers may not last as gases can seep through the plastic.</p>

							<p>For long-term storage of dry goods, aluminized Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers should be used and stored inside five-gallon plastic buckets. This ensures protection from all types of pests and guarantees the food will still be edible when opened. Online retailers sell Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers, while food-grade buckets are available at local home improvement centers.</p>

							<p>To pack food this way:</p>

							<ol>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Gather a large amount of food as oxygen absorbers work quickly and it&#39;s best to do a lot at once.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Open six-gallon aluminized Mylar bags and place them inside five-gallon buckets.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Fill the bags with food, leaving about an inch below the bucket&#39;s rim. It&#39;s recommended to remove the original packaging and put only one type of food in each bucket.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Label the contents of the bucket in several places on the outside.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Use a hair straightener to seal the top two inches of the bag, leaving a two-inch gap at one end.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Quickly insert an oxygen absorber into the bag&#39;s opening. Having an assistant to seal the package of oxygen absorbers back up may be helpful.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Quickly place the vacuum cleaner hose just inside the opening of the bag&#39;s seal and remove as much air as possible. Avoid putting the hose or nozzle too far inside, or food will be sucked out.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Remove the vacuum cleaner hose and seal the bag completely.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Fold over the bag&#39;s ends to lay flat on top of the food, then hammer the lid onto the bucket with a rubber mallet.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>It&#39;s important to store food stored using this method in a cool and dry area. The buckets are waterproof, except for the wire handle, allowing for the possibility of creating hidden caches of food by burying them. When storing food in your home, it&#39;s recommended to scatter it into different, preferably hidden locations. This is to ensure that in case someone breaks into your home looking for food, they won&#39;t be able to find all of it.</p>

							<p><br />
							&nbsp;</p>

							<p><strong>Managing Your Supplies</strong></p>

							<p>To ensure that you are not wasting your food stockpile, portion control is essential, even if it means leaving family members hungry. Your survival menu should not only consider the nutrients in the food but also total calories. Therefore, it is recommended to develop 2,000, 1,800, and 1,500 calorie per day plans. In severe situations, you may have to cut down on food consumption to make it last longer. Although living on 1,500 calories per day may cause you to lose weight, it is still possible to survive.</p>

							<p>It is important to remember that those who have not prepared will not have the same resources as you and your family. They may be losing weight and struggling to find food. By contrast, if your family is not losing weight, it could be seen as an indication that you have plenty of food to eat. Although a low-calorie diet may not be enjoyable, it is ultimately better for your family&#39;s safety than being attacked by hungry individuals who want to steal your food and are willing to harm you to get it.</p>

							<p>In conclusion, rationing your supplies and controlling portion sizes will be essential to make your food last longer in emergency situations. Developing menus with different calorie options can also be beneficial in conserving your food resources. Finally, remember that being well-prepared may give you an advantage over others who are not, and taking precautions to avoid being a target for those who are desperate for food is crucial for your family&#39;s safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Cooking in the Absence of Power or Gas Supply</strong></p>

							<p>It is highly likely that electricity will be unavailable during any disaster, with power outages being caused by even a strong storm. Our electrical grid is a fragile part of the infrastructure, and anything more severe than a storm will likely result in power outages. In addition, natural gas companies may stop pumping gas if the situation is dire enough. But how can you cook without electricity or gas? The solution is not as daunting as it seems, as people have been cooking for centuries without modern stoves. There are several options to consider:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Coleman &quot;dual fuel&quot; stove - burns gasoline</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Barbecue grille - can burn wood, regardless of propane or charcoal type, always have an extra tank for propane</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fire pit - can be modified with grates for cooking, typically burns wood</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fireplace or wood-burning stove - centuries-old option for cooking in homes, some newer models may be harder to use for cooking.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Consider adding a solar oven to your arsenal of cooking methods. A simple solar oven typically consists of a box with clear plastic or glass on the front and reflective panels on the sides that direct sunlight into the box. The heat generated by the sunlight cooks the food inside the box. Cooking with a solar oven is similar to using a slow cooker, so it&#39;s important to allow plenty of time for the food to cook.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>OTHER ESSENTIAL ITEMS TO STOCKPILE</strong></p>

							<p>A prepping stockpile typically consists of food and water, but it&#39;s important to remember that we use other items on a daily or nearly daily basis as well. That&#39;s why we need to stockpile everything that meets our survival necessities. While it may be impossible to stockpile everything we need, every item we add to our stockpile is one more that will make life easier in a post-disaster world.</p>

							<p>However, it&#39;s important to note that we&#39;re talking about survival necessities here - the things that meet our critical needs. Each family is unique, so it&#39;s important to take their needs into consideration when building a stockpile. Additionally, it&#39;s worth considering things that will help your family survive the isolation of survival, without having access to their usual entertainment options like cell phones, video games, or the internet.</p>

							<p>While we won&#39;t list any specific items, it&#39;s important to think about what your family needs and what will make their lives easier during a disaster. We should all have a good idea of what these things are, considering the COVID-19 pandemic and the stay-at-home orders that many people experienced. Ultimately, the goal is to stockpile items that will help us survive and thrive during and after a disaster.</p>

							<p><strong>Heating and Lighting Options For Emergency Situations</strong></p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Stockpile <strong>firewood</strong> for heating your home with a fireplace or wood-burning stove</li>

								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fuel &ndash; Have a good supply of gasoline for your car, lawnmower, and chain saw. Oil lamps may also come in handy</li>
							</ul>

							<p>When it comes to prepping for emergencies, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is important to consider your own situation, especially the things you use regularly. With the assumption that stores won&#39;t have what you need during an emergency, it&#39;s a good idea to have some spares.</p>

							<p>One way to stock up on emergency supplies is to buy extra when you are already purchasing them. This is more budget-friendly and saves time. For instance, if you typically buy a big pack of paper towels, you could increase your stocking level to two packs, then later to three. This way, stockpiling becomes a natural part of your routine, rather than a chore.</p>

							<p>Moreover, buying items on sale can help save money and build up your prepping stockpile. Many common items go on sale annually or quarterly, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with buying enough for the entire year when they are on sale. The author has been working this way for years, only buying items on sale, from laundry detergent to computer paper, keeping their stockpile up while saving money.</p>

							<p>In conclusion, while this is not an exhaustive list, it is a starting point to consider for emergency preparedness. It is vital to assess your own needs and consider what you use on a daily basis to make sure you have the necessary items in case of an emergency. By increasing your normal stocking levels and taking advantage of sales, you can save money and build up your stockpile at the same time.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROTECTING YOURSELF DURING A PANDEMIC</strong></p>

							<p>In the previous chapter, I included HAZMAT personal protection equipment as an important item to stockpile. We&#39;ve all witnessed how medical masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers became scarce almost overnight during the pandemic. I monitored stores daily to observe how the impending pandemic was affecting inventory levels and saw how items were quickly snatched off the shelves from one day to the next. If another pandemic occurs (which is highly possible), we can expect a similar scenario to unfold.</p>

							<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the devastating effects pandemics can have in the modern world. Air travel has enabled pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to spread around the world in a matter of days. With diseases like this having lengthy incubation periods, they can infect thousands of people before anyone even realizes it&#39;s there.</p>

							<p>The issue lies partly in the consumption of unusual food in China and other regions of the world. Whether the virus originated from the meat market or the bio-research lab in China, it came from a bat like many other diseases. The virus does not harm its host animal but can be catastrophic when it infects humans. It is possible for another epidemic or pandemic to spread across the world again and cause widespread death. In comparison, the Coronavirus pandemic was relatively mild in terms of fatalities. Imagine the devastation if a disease like Ebola were to spread in a similar manner.</p>

							<p>While I&#39;m withholding judgment on whether the government&#39;s actions destroyed the economy until I see how quickly it rebounds, I believe that many of the measures taken were appropriate in slowing down the spread of the disease. These measures include telecommuting for those who can, closing schools, public events, and other meeting places, social distancing to avoid coughs and sneezes, washing hands thoroughly, and wearing multi-layered cloth masks (not medical masks) to prevent the disease from spreading. Avoiding unnecessary trips to crowded public areas is also important.</p>

							<p>Initially, when the novel coronavirus was announced, people in certain countries, such as Japan, took the initiative to wear masks without being told, which helped in slowing the spread of the disease. Japan also became the first country to shut down its schools, further reducing the spread of the virus. While there has been some debate over the efficacy of masks, statistics show that they can be highly effective:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">If healthy people wear masks but infected individuals don&#39;t, there is a 70% chance of contracting the disease.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">If infected individuals wear masks but healthy people don&#39;t, there is only a 5% chance of catching the disease.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">If both infected and healthy individuals wear masks, the likelihood of catching the disease drops to only 1.5%.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>It is clear that wearing masks is the best defense against pandemics. Therefore, if there is news about a potential outbreak, it is wise to start wearing masks immediately, even if there are no known cases in your area. Personally, I would rather be considered overly cautious for wearing a mask than risk catching a deadly disease by leaving it off to avoid appearing strange.</p>

							<p>This also means preparing a stockpile of essential supplies to fight against a pandemic, such as:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Cloth masks, N-95 masks, or chemical respirators, which are better than surgical masks.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Disposable gloves, for use only in places like the supermarket, and discarded after leaving.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Tyvek booties to wear over shoes in supermarkets to prevent carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus into homes.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Hand sanitizer for situations where there is no water.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Disinfectants and disinfectant wipes for cleaning everything, especially items brought into the home.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Vitamins to boost the immune system.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Tyvek suits for use as HAZMAT suits if you need to go to a highly infected area.</li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Disinfection</strong></p>

							<p>To ensure that your home is free of contamination, it is crucial to assume that everything you bring in is contaminated unless proven otherwise. Therefore, it is recommended to set up a decontamination station at your doorstep and use disinfectants like chlorine bleach, 60% or greater alcohol, or 3% hydrogen peroxide to clean every package before bringing it inside. For difficult-to-clean packaging, open it and remove the contents, which can be cleaned, and dispose of the packaging in an outdoor trash can.</p>

							<p>However, certain items like fruits and vegetables should not be decontaminated with these chemicals. Instead, they should be washed with normal soap and water in the sink to remove bacteria and kill viruses, just like washing your hands. By taking these precautions, you can ensure that your home remains a safe and healthy environment.</p>

							<p><strong>DIY Sanitizer</strong></p>

							<p>Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, hand sanitizer quickly became scarce in stores, leading many people to create their own. However, due to a lack of knowledge or carelessness, numerous individuals made the sanitizer incorrectly, resulting in a product with inadequate disinfectant properties. Although the CDC recommends a minimum of 60% alcohol content for effective sanitation, many individuals utilized 70% alcohol in their homemade recipes but failed to account for the addition of other ingredients, ultimately leaving them with a final alcohol content of only 45%. To ensure the correct composition, one should use the following recipe: 2 cups (1 pint) of 91% rubbing alcohol, 1 cup of aloe vera gel, and 15 drops of antibacterial essential oil, such as tea tree or lavender oil.</p>

							<p><strong>Disinfecting with Clorox Wipes and Other Disinfectants during Pandemics</strong></p>

							<p>When it comes to disinfecting products, Clorox is a household name and a popular choice for many. Its effectiveness as a disinfectant can be attributed to the powerful properties of bleach, which is known for its ability to sanitize and is often used for cleaning in commercial kitchens. The Clorox disinfectant and cleaner is available in a convenient spray bottle or as Clorox wipes, a popular choice for quick and easy sanitization.</p>

							<p>If you run out of Clorox disinfectant or wipes, you can easily make your own at home using simple ingredients.</p>

							<p>To create the cleaner and disinfectant, mix 1/3 cup of plain Clorox bleach (not scented or color-safe) with one gallon of water and 1/2 cup of dishwashing liquid.</p>

							<p>To make your own Clorox wipes, follow the above recipe and then cut a roll of blue paper towels sold in auto parts stores in half, making them roughly the same size as a roll of toilet paper. Soak the roll of towels in the disinfectant until they are fully saturated, then remove the cardboard core. Place the roll into a container, such as an empty wipes container or a large square container. Pull out the end of the towel from the center of the roll and start using. To keep the towels wet, pour about 1/4 cup of the disinfectant into the bottom of the container.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>HOW TO START A FIRE</strong></p>

							<p>Starting a fire is a fundamental skill that is crucial for survival in any outdoor or emergency situation. Despite its importance, many people struggle with starting a fire. It may seem like a simple task, but it requires a basic understanding of fire-building techniques and materials.</p>

							<p>In many cases, people who struggle with starting a fire simply do not know how to do it correctly. They may attempt to light a fire with insufficient materials or use ineffective techniques that fail to ignite the flames. These individuals may find themselves in serious trouble if they ever need to start a fire to survive.</p>

							<p><strong>How</strong></p>

							<p>Fire starting can be easy if you know what materials to use. These materials can be categorized into three basic groups: tinder, kindling, and fuel. Tinder refers to small pieces of material that catch fire easily, such as dry grass, char-cloth, cotton balls, cattail fluff, dry leaves, dry bark, or dandelion clock. Kindling consists of small sticks, approximately the diameter of your finger, that can ignite from the tinder. This can include split pieces of &ldquo;fuzz sticks&rdquo;. Fuel refers to split pieces of dry tree branch or trunk, about the diameter of your arm, that can ignite from the kindling. It is important that the heartwood is exposed, as bark will protect the wood from burning.</p>

							<p>When laying the fire, it is crucial to lay it in a way that ignites the tinder first. Once the tinder catches fire, it will ignite the kindling, which can then ignite the fuel. The most common way to accomplish this is by making a teepee or a stepped pyramid out of the materials.</p>

							<p>Recently, some people have suggested using a top-down fire starting method, where the kindling is piled on top of the fuel, with the tinder on top of that. However, this method doesn&#39;t always work because heat rises, it doesn&rsquo;t go down.</p>

							<p>Once the fire is burning well, you can add full logs to it. Many people will lay a large log or two in their fire at night, so that it has enough to burn through until morning.</p>

							<p><strong>Starters</strong></p>

							<p>Fire starters can be divided into two main categories: primary and secondary. The only fire starters that are considered primary are matches and lighters, as they are the most effective. Everything else, including Ferro Rods, are considered to be secondary fire starters. It is recommended to have a couple of secondary fire starters on hand in case something happens to your primary ones, although primary fire starters should be used whenever possible to save effort.</p>

							<p>One of the biggest issues with most fire starters is that they are often ineffective in windy or rainy conditions. Waterproof matches are commonly recommended as a primary fire starter, particularly those that are strike anywhere matches. However, even waterproof matches can be ineffective in windy conditions. Storm proof matches are a good investment, as they can be ignited and burned in the wind or rain, and even underwater. Similarly, storm proof lighters, such as electric arc or piezoelectric fired butane gas lighters, are constantly igniting, preventing them from going out in adverse weather conditions.</p>

							<p>The Ferro Rod is the most common secondary fire starter, but it can be challenging to use as it only produces a few sparks, especially with smaller ones. Some larger Ferro Rods are made of magnesium, which is more effective despite being mistakenly referred to as Ferro Rods. The Blastmatch or Sparkie are good alternatives to Ferro Rods, as they are magnesium rods mounted into a spring-loaded handle, with a striker that produces many more sparks, increasing the likelihood of starting a fire.</p>

							<p>For a simpler and cheaper secondary fire starter, a Metal Match is an option. It consists of a block of magnesium with a Ferro Rod embedded into one edge. Some magnesium dust is scraped off with a knife, and the Ferro Rod is used to create a spark, igniting the magnesium, which burns at a high temperature, making it very effective.</p>

							<p><strong>Starting a Fire in Wet Weather Conditions</strong></p>

							<p>Starting a fire in wet weather can be a challenging task, even for the best of fire starters. One of the biggest problems is finding dry tinder, kindling, and fuel. In the past, our ancestors would carry a tinder box with them to keep their tinder dry and a flint and steel to start a fire. While dry tinder is a good starting point, you need dry kindling and fuel as well. One way to find dry kindling and fuel is to look in sheltered places where the rain cannot reach it. Fallen trees, caves or overhangs, and thickets are some examples of sheltered areas.</p>

							<p>It is also important to have a protected area where you can lay your fire. A rock bed can be useful as it will keep the fire off of the wet ground. Adding a windbreak such as stones, piled wood, a tarp, or a rescue blanket on the upwind side of the fire can help protect it from the wind and rain. Overhead protection in the form of tree branches can also prevent the rain from extinguishing the fire.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s essential to gather dry wood, but it&#39;s okay to gather damp wood as well. Just remember that the damp wood will need to be placed near the fire for some time to dry out. You can use the damp wood as part of the windbreak or a heat reflector, and it will dry out while helping you get the most out of your fire.</p>

							<p><strong>Enhancers</strong></p>

							<p>Starting a fire in wet weather can be a challenge, even with the best preparation and ingredients. In such situations, it may be necessary to use a chemical accelerant to get the fire going. Accelerants are any flammable chemicals used to start a fire, and while the term is typically associated with arson, it is also applicable in this case.</p>

							<p>There are chemical accelerants specifically designed for survival purposes that can be purchased. They are often marketed as &quot;fire starters,&quot; although this can be confusing as it refers to the fire starters mentioned earlier. The WetFire cube is one of the most effective chemical accelerants, and even a small piece of it can start a fire in the harshest of conditions.</p>

							<p>Alternatively, an excellent fire accelerant can be made using cotton balls and petroleum jelly. To create this, place a cotton ball into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to scoop out about a teaspoon of petroleum jelly. Work the petroleum jelly into the cotton ball until it is evenly distributed. These cotton balls can then be ignited using any of the fire starters mentioned above and will burn for over three minutes at a high enough temperature to dry out and ignite damp kindling.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PART 2 - DEVELOPING A RELIABLE STRATEGY</strong></p>

							<p>When it comes to surviving a crisis or disaster, it&#39;s often more practical to use your home as a shelter rather than abandoning it for an uncertain future. Staying at home means having access to all of your possessions, and even non-survival items can prove useful in certain circumstances. However, in order to survive at home, there are important steps and decisions you need to make to be prepared.</p>

							<p>In the first section, we talked about quick actions you can take to increase your family&#39;s chances of survival, such as stockpiling food and water. But that&#39;s just the beginning. In this section, we&#39;ll go deeper and create a comprehensive survival plan. Some of the things we&#39;ll discuss may take longer to implement, but they will greatly increase your chances of survival and prepare you for a longer period of time.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to remember that every step you take towards preparedness will make a difference in your family&#39;s survival. Even small efforts can have a big impact. So, we&#39;ll cover a range of topics in this section, including building your stockpile, creating a communication plan, fortifying your home, and much more. By the end, you&#39;ll have a solid plan in place to ensure your family&#39;s safety and well-being in the event of a disaster or crisis.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>BE MENTALLY REPARED</strong></p>

							<p>Survival involves more than just physical preparation; it also requires the right mental attitude. In fact, military manuals on survival always start with a section discussing the development of a &ldquo;survival mentality.&rdquo; This attitude is characterized by the belief that you can survive, regardless of the circumstances. It has been proven effective in a wide range of survival situations, including those that are not related to the outdoors.</p>

							<p>Studies have shown that police officers who are shot in the line of duty are more likely to survive if they believe they will survive, and cancer patients with a positive attitude are more likely to survive than those who believe that cancer will kill them. This is due to the will to live, which drives people to do whatever is necessary to survive. Those who lack this will are more likely to give up and let fate have its way.</p>

							<p>The will to live is crucial in survival situations, as it motivates us through the hard physical work required to survive. We must be convinced that we can do it, and training is key to building that confidence. As we learn more survival skills and prepare ourselves by buying the right gear and supplies, we become more confident in our ability to survive. This is evident in the military, where training gives soldiers the confidence they need to survive. The more training they have, the more confident they become, and highly trained groups like Delta Force or the Navy SEALs are made up of highly confident people.</p>

							<p>In summary, developing a survival mentality is crucial to survival. It requires the belief that you can survive and the will to live, which motivates us through the hard physical work required to survive. With training and preparation, we can build the confidence we need to survive in any situation.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND INFORMATION</strong></p>

							<p>In the world of survival preparation, the concept of operational security, also known as OPSEC, is highly valued. This military term holds great significance for us as we prepare for the next disaster. It is essential to understand that we are vastly outnumbered by individuals who do not possess the skills or willingness to survive. Some may rely on the government for assistance while others may scoff at the idea of preparing for disaster altogether. However, the most perilous group are those who may come knocking at our doors, expecting us to care for them. Therefore, it is crucial to take necessary precautions to protect ourselves and maintain operational security.</p>

							<p>The concept of operational security, or &quot;OPSEC,&quot; is crucial for those preparing for the next disaster. Unfortunately, many people are unwilling to prepare for such events, putting those who do at risk. It&#39;s not uncommon for people to say they&#39;ll just come knocking on your door if something happens. While charity is important, it&#39;s impossible to stockpile enough resources for everyone. It&#39;s best to focus on helping those closest to you with a limited amount of supplies.</p>

							<p>Allowing strangers to come to your door for assistance can be dangerous, as they may resort to violence if refused. The best approach is to maintain secrecy about your preparations to prevent people from knowing what you have. The more people know about your supplies, the more likely they are to come knocking. To maintain OPSEC, it&#39;s important to limit who you tell and avoid flaunting your preparations.</p>

							<p>How?<br />
							Purchase in secret: Avoid having large shipments show up at your door, unload in a closed garage or backyard</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Hide your stockpile: Conceal your stockpile from friends and family visiting your home; use camouflage if you can&#39;t hide it</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Disinformation: Mislead neighbors by saying your alternative energy source (e.g., wind turbine or solar panels) is not for emergency power but for alternative energy</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Avoid looking like an armed camp: Don&#39;t do things that make your home look like a concentration camp (e.g., building a 10-foot high cement wall)</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Don&#39;t look &quot;tacticool&quot;: Avoid clothing or accessories that make you look like a prepper or survivalist</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Keep it from your kids: Kids can&#39;t keep secrets, so avoid telling them about your preparations</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">During a disaster: Avoid having trash piled up, find ways to cook without giving away the scent of food, practice noise and light discipline (keep the volume down and use blackout curtains)</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Practice noise discipline: Keep the volume down on your electrical devices (music, movies) so that the neighbors cannot hear it.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Practice light discipline: Cover your windows with blackout curtains to prevent light from escaping.</li>
							</ul>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Group Survival VS. Solo Survival: Which is Better?</strong></p>

							<p>It&#39;s not uncommon for people to develop a lone-wolf survival mentality, thinking that they can survive on their own without help from others. This is especially true if others view them as a &quot;survival expert.&quot; However, this mindset can be dangerous and misguided.</p>

							<p>The idea of the lone-wolf survivalist can be romanticized, with images of mountain men surviving on their own in the past. However, those men were often much tougher and more rugged than modern individuals. Many still died from various hazards, including animal attacks, accidents, and hypothermia.</p>

							<p>The world that the mountain men lived in was different from today&#39;s world. Nature provided much of what they needed, and they didn&#39;t have to worry about contaminated water sources. Today, we have to face not only the risks of nature but also two-legged predators who may harm us during a crisis.</p>

							<p>Although mountain men did face problems with American Indians, the sparse population of Native Americans meant that meeting them was unlikely. When they did interact, they were not usually intent on murder, contrary to what history books may suggest. In fact, some mountain men had good relations with various Indian tribes.</p>

							<p>However, the risks faced by modern individuals during a crisis are much higher, with hungry mobs willing to steal food and kill whoever stands in their way. Trying to survive as a lone-wolf is too risky unless someone is confident that they can take on a gang of 10 or 12 adversaries.</p>

							<p>Going it alone in a survival situation can be incredibly challenging due to the sheer amount of work that needs to be done. From defense to gathering and purifying water, growing food, making repairs, and everything in between, the workload can quickly become overwhelming, especially in a long-term scenario. Having a survival team can help to alleviate this burden by spreading the workload and sharing the responsibility of defense. Additionally, there is safety in numbers, as attackers are less likely to target a group than an individual or a small family.</p>

							<p>However, finding like-minded individuals to form a survival group with can be a challenge. Many survivalists are secretive about their activities, as discussed in the previous chapter. But there are places where you can find them, such as shooting ranges. It may take some effort and patience to locate and connect with potential group members, but it can be done.</p>

							<p>Forming a survival group also offers the opportunity to bring together individuals with different areas of expertise. This allows for a more efficient division of labor, as each member can focus on their areas of strength while still receiving cross-training in other essential skills. While there should be some overlap in knowledge and abilities within the group, having specialists in different areas can help to ensure that all necessary tasks are covered.</p>

							<p>So, what types of skills should you prioritize when forming a survival group?</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">General survival: It&#39;s important to have at least one member of the group who is a true survival expert.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Military (especially infantry): You will need to defend yourselves.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Medical: A team medic is necessary to take care of injuries.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Gardening or farming: You will need someone who can grow food for the team.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Animal husbandry: Raising animals for food is another important skill to have.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Food preservation: You need someone who can preserve the food you grow.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">General repairs: Someone who can fix things and keep everything working is essential.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Some additional skills you might want to have:</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Midwifery: Someone who can help women during childbirth.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Hunting: Raising animals is more efficient, but hunting for food is still useful.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fishing: Another way to bring in food.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Communications: A ham radio operator can help you keep in touch with the world and find out what&#39;s going on.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Blacksmith: If you can find one, they can make just about anything out of metal, including tools and weapons.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Woodworking: Someone who can make things you might need.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Tanning &amp; leatherworking: Someone who can turn animal hides into leather and that leather into useful things.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Cobbler: A lost art these days, but someone who can repair shoes is useful.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Teacher: Someone who can teach the children.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Sewing and/or weaving: Making cloth and turning that cloth into clothing. Altering clothing that you find.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Counselor: A minister or professional counselor might be needed to help people adjust to the situation.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>It&#39;s important to clarify that being an expert in a certain area doesn&#39;t mean that person will do everything in that area. Rather, they will lead in that area and everyone will contribute as they can. It&#39;s not fair for someone to be idle just because they&#39;re the &quot;communicator&quot; and expect others to provide for them.</p>

							<p>While having the right skills is important, it&#39;s even more important to have people who can get along with each other. Strife within the group can lead to implosion and leave everyone in a bad situation.</p>

							<p>A leader will need to be chosen, and it&#39;s up to the group how they select that person. They should prioritize the needs of the group and be fair in their dealings with everyone. Ideally, the leader should be someone who doesn&#39;t want the job, as this can indicate they&#39;re not in it for power. They should also possess good leadership skills and be respected by the group.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SURVIVAL IN URBAN VS. RURAL ENVIRONMENTS</strong></p>

							<p>In the United States, the majority of the population, approximately 80%, lives in urban areas. This figure can be further broken down as 52% living in suburban areas and 28% living in urban areas, also known as &quot;center city.&quot; Only 20% of the overall population lives in rural areas.</p>

							<p>Many people believe that those living in rural areas have an advantage in survival situations due to a lower population density to availability of resources ratio. While this is generally true, there is a common misconception that rural areas, especially farming communities, have an abundance of food that can be shared with people living in urban areas. In reality, unless it is just after harvest time, farming communities typically only have enough food for their own needs, rather than enough to feed the world.</p>

							<p>When it comes to prepping and surviving a disaster, most of the information available is written from the viewpoint of suburbia. Many preppers believe that it makes more sense to live in a suburban area or on the edge of a suburban area, where they have enough land for gardening and even raising chickens.</p>

							<p>There are several specific differences between urban and rural survival. Let&rsquo;s discuss each.</p>

							<p><strong>Government Assistance</strong></p>

							<p>When it comes to aid during a disaster, preppers are not big fans of government aid, as they believe that FEMA doesn&rsquo;t have a good reputation for providing aid effectively. Even if they do provide aid, it&#39;s usually in the form of financial aid, which comes with many restrictions and may cause more problems for people in the long run. However, it&#39;s worth noting that if there is any government aid to be had, it will be directed towards big cities first, and it may not make it much farther than that. While we shouldn&#39;t rely solely on government aid, it&#39;s likely that people will be grateful for whatever assistance they can get when the time comes.</p>

							<p>In addition to aid, law and order will also be associated with any government action taken during a disaster. While crime rates are typically higher in large cities, the police presence is generally more significant as well. This larger police presence can be helpful in combating the gangs that tend to emerge in the aftermath of a major disaster. However, it&#39;s important to note that this assumes that the police organization remains intact during the disaster. If the police organization breaks down, it could make the situation even more dangerous.</p>

							<p><strong>Food and Water Supply</strong></p>

							<p>Living in an urban center presents a unique challenge for preppers. Due to the lack of space, it is difficult for city-dwellers to stockpile large amounts of food and water. Additionally, access to groundwater or the ability to grow their own food is limited for most urban residents. Those living in rural areas or on the outskirts of suburban areas have an advantage in this regard as they typically have larger lots and the ability to grow their own food.</p>

							<p>Living in rural areas or the outskirts of suburbs provides preppers with the ability to become self-sufficient rather than just relying on stockpiling. With larger lots, they have the space to grow vegetables, fruit trees, and raise animals for food. They can also drill wells for water or use rainwater capture. This allows them to change their survival focus from solely stockpiling to becoming self-sufficient.</p>

							<p>The suburbs provide a good balance between urban and rural areas. However, the closer one gets to the city center, the more they have to depend on stockpiling and the less they can rely on growing their own food. Those living in the city center will face the need to evacuate sooner than those in rural areas in the event of a TEOTWAWKI event. In such scenarios, unprepared people will likely move towards rural areas in search of essential supplies.</p>

							<p>The migration of people can be advantageous to preppers living in the city center, as they will have enough supplies to see them through. Once the city empties out, they will have access to a significant amount of non-food resources that they can scavenge. They could potentially be the group of people with the potential to rebuild society.</p>

							<p><strong>Personal Protection/Self Defense</strong></p>

							<p>Rural communities face a significant disadvantage in terms of self-defense. Although more people in these communities may own guns, they are also spread out over a greater area. This dispersion will make it difficult for them to coordinate a cohesive defense. Their only option may be to blockade the entrances to their towns, but unless they have natural barriers to support them, these blockades will be ineffective against the hordes of people leaving cities in search of vital resources. These individuals will be desperate and prepared to do whatever it takes to get what they need. If they are unable to reach the small towns by road, they will resort to cross-country travel. Since most will be traveling on foot, there will be little stopping them.</p>

							<p>To make matters worse, these desperate people will seek out isolated homes to attack, attempting to steal whatever they can. Many families will be killed as they try to defend their homes alone, overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

							<p>Living in the center city will provide little solace, unless a home or apartment is exceedingly secure. Rather than loosely-formed gangs gathering together merely to steal food, it will be organized gangs that have existed long before the disaster, with many involved in criminal activity. Before moving out into the countryside in search of food, these gangs will attempt to find food within their own neighborhoods. Violent crime in the inner city will surge until these gangs realize they must venture farther afield to find what they need.</p>

							<p>Once again, it is the people in the suburbs who will have the most significant advantage, provided they organize themselves to defend their homes. The proximity of homes, as well as cul-de-sacs, provides an opportunity to create a defensive perimeter and protect their homes. However, this will only be effective if there are enough people in the neighborhood who have firearms and know how to use them.</p>

							

							<p><strong><span style="font-size:15pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#343541">A Comparison of a Short-Term and Long-Term Perspectives</strong></p>

							<p>Looking into the future, we can expect significant changes in three areas. Rural areas are likely to have the highest survival rate, thanks to their abundance of food per capita. However, they will have to adjust to a more primitive lifestyle, as they will not have access to electricity or other resources that are necessary for rebuilding society.</p>

							<p>On the other hand, those in the center of the city will have the most access to resources necessary for rebuilding society in the long term, assuming they survive. However, the key will be the lack of basic resources. Those who have stockpiles of food and access to water will be the only ones with any food at all, unless the government is able to bring food into the city. Once again, government efforts will likely focus on the cities and not the rural areas.</p>

							

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>MAINTAINING A WARM HOME</strong></p>

							

							<p>In this section of the book, we will discuss the importance of maintaining body heat as a survival priority, especially in cold weather. However, the topic was not discussed in the previous section, for two reasons. Firstly, depending on the location and time of year of the disaster, heating the home may not be necessary. Secondly, making the necessary changes to the home to enable heating without electricity is not a quick fix and may take some time.</p>

							<p>Most modern homes are heated with electricity, natural gas, or propane, using a central HVAC system. Even if the heat is generated by burning natural gas, electricity is still needed to run the controls and power the blower or pump. In case of a power outage, the heating system will not function. If the outage persists, the natural gas pumping stations may also shut down, leaving homes without any source of heat. Without heating, temperatures inside the house will start dropping within hours and will reach the outside temperature in a day or two, depending on the insulation.</p>

							<p>Surviving for a few days without heating is possible, even in cold climates, but it has its limits. The colder the temperature, the more energy the body needs to keep warm. In a time when food may be scarce, the body will require more energy, putting a strain on the body&#39;s resources.</p>

							<p>The best solution is to have an alternative heating method, such as burning wood. Wood-burning stoves or fireplaces can provide heat and light without electricity. However, using wood as a source of heat requires preparation, such as collecting, chopping, and storing wood, and ensuring proper ventilation. Other alternative heating methods, such as propane heaters or kerosene heaters, may also be considered, but they have their own set of challenges and safety risks. Whatever the heating method chosen, it is crucial to have a plan and the necessary supplies to stay warm in case of a power outage or other emergency.</p>

							<p><strong>Choosing Between Fireplace and Wood-Burning Stove</strong></p>

							<p>Wood is a popular heating choice for many due to its abundance and renewability. For those considering wood as their heating source, the choice usually comes down to a fireplace or a wood-burning stove. While it may seem like an aesthetic decision, there is a significant difference between the two. Fireplaces are inefficient, as they send most of the heat up the chimney. In contrast, wood-burning stoves radiate heat from all sides, making them more effective in heating a room.</p>

							<p>Modern wood-burning stoves have improved designs, complying with EPA regulations to increase burning efficiency. However, it is essential to ensure that the stove you purchase is rated to provide heat. Avoid wood-burning stoves that use wood pellets for fuel, as they require a specific fuel source. Installing any wood-burning stove or fireplace can be challenging, especially if you have a two-story home.</p>

							<p>It is crucial to keep in mind that wood-burning stoves work by radiant heat, making them ineffective in heating the whole house. Heat will rise and may move into upstairs rooms by convection, but the living area will remain the warmest. In cold weather, family members may have to sleep in the living room if their bedrooms are too cold.</p>

							<p><strong>Temporary Wood-Burning Stove Installation</strong></p>

							<p>If you can&#39;t install a wood-burning stove permanently, it may still be possible to use it temporarily in an emergency. To do so, you&#39;ll need to create a fire-resistant area on your floor using clay tiles or bricks. Ensure that you have two layers to prevent sparks from falling through to flammable materials below.</p>

							<p>The chimney can be run out through a window, requiring you to either cut a hole in the glass or remove a pane of glass. If you remove the window pane, you can use a piece of plywood to fill the gap. You&#39;ll also need to purchase elbows to direct the chimney above the stove and outside, ensuring that it reaches above the roof to allow smoke to dissipate.</p>

							<p>While this method may not radiate heat as effectively as older chimney pipe designs, it can still be used with a slight upward slant towards the outside. Once the emergency is over, the stove can be removed and the window can be restored to its normal state.</p>

							<p><strong>Locating Firewood</strong></p>

							<p>To get the best value from your wood-burning stove, it is recommended to use hardwood firewood instead of pine. Hardwoods are known to have a higher energy density, and using four to six cords of hardwood firewood in a winter would provide better value for your money compared to pine.</p>

							<p>One way to acquire firewood is by purchasing it, but it can be quite expensive, with the typical face cord of wood costing between $200 to $500 depending on location. However, there are several ways to acquire firewood for free, such as putting up an announcement in a grocery store or on Craig&#39;s List offering to remove dead trees or limbs for free. You can also check with contractors who need to clear land or the city when trees need to be trimmed.</p>

							<p>Damaged pallets are also a good source of firewood, as they are usually not recycled. You can inquire from places that recycle pallets and ask what they do with the damaged ones. It is essential to store the firewood in a way that protects it from rain, as wet wood can waste a lot of heat energy. Covering it with a tarp is a simple way to prevent the rain from getting to the firewood.</p>

							<p><strong>Others</strong></p>

							<p>Heating your home with wood is the most common method, but it&#39;s not the only option. Propane and kerosene heaters can also be used, but they require a good supply of fuel and are not easily replaceable. Although they may work well in the short-term, they may not be a long-term solution, and wood heating may eventually become necessary. Propane radiant and kerosene heaters don&#39;t need electricity to function, making them a viable option during power outages.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>READY YOUR FIRST AID</strong></p>

							<p>During a disaster, the likelihood of injury increases significantly, especially during physical work such as cutting and hauling wood. This is compounded by the fact that medical facilities become overwhelmed during disasters, as more people are injured by the disaster or its aftermath. Hospital waiting rooms become overcrowded, and patients may face long wait times, even for serious injuries.</p>

							<p>Given this reality, it is essential to be prepared to take care of medical problems yourself, particularly injuries. However, this is not a matter of having a basic first-aid kit. Serious injuries such as cuts from an axe or chainsaw, gunshot wounds, or falls from a roof require a &quot;trauma kit.&quot;</p>

							<p>A trauma kit is more comprehensive than a standard first-aid kit and contains high-quality medical supplies. You can purchase a trauma kit from various sources, or you can create your own. The advantage of making your kit is that you can ensure that it is stocked with quality supplies and spares, allowing you to take care of multiple injuries. Most commercial trauma kits do not provide this option unless you purchase an EMT kit.</p>

							<p>A trauma kit can be housed in anything with compartments, making organization vital to finding what you need quickly. It is essential to prepare a trauma kit before a disaster, so you are not left searching for medical supplies in the midst of an emergency.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to have an adequate supply of prescription medications for family members who require them for chronic conditions. You will need to consult with your physician to obtain a prescription for these medications. In some cases, you may need to travel to Mexico to purchase them over-the-counter at pharmacies.</p>

							<p>Similarly, while it&#39;s essential to use antibiotics judiciously, it&#39;s crucial to have them on hand in case of a severe infection. Infections can be life-threatening, and timely treatment with antibiotics can save lives. If you&#39;re unable to travel to Mexico to purchase antibiotics, some veterinary medications are identical to human antibiotics, manufactured in the same factories but sold under different names and packaging.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SANITATION</strong></p>

							<p>Personal hygiene is often thought of as a way to avoid offending others, but its role in disease prevention is equally crucial. The importance of personal hygiene and sanitation gained recognition with the development of the germ theory of disease in the mid to late 1800s. Prior to that, people paid little attention to bathing or hand-washing.</p>

							<p>Most of the unpleasant odors that we seek to eliminate through bathing are caused by bacteria on our bodies and the substances they produce. Thus, maintaining personal hygiene is necessary for maintaining sanitation. However, we tend not to think of it this way.</p>

							<p>Disasters and epidemics often coincide due to the proliferation of disease-carrying pests, such as rodents and flies, and the general lack of hygiene. In such situations, it can be difficult to maintain cleanliness when water is scarce, let alone to keep one&#39;s home clean.</p>

							<p>Nevertheless, maintaining cleanliness is critical during such times. The challenge is finding ways to stay clean without using excessive amounts of water, particularly potable water.</p>

							<p><strong>Hand Disinfectant</strong></p>

							<p>Using hand sanitizer is generally sufficient for most purposes, as it can effectively reduce the transmission of disease pathogens. These pathogens often enter our bodies through the openings in our face, and are frequently carried by our hands, which come into contact with contaminated surfaces or fluids from sick individuals. Although hand sanitizer may not be able to eliminate all microscopic pathogens, it can effectively kill most of them, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of infection. Thus, it is important to use hand sanitizer whenever there is uncertainty about the cleanliness of a surface or object.</p>

							<p>To ensure an adequate supply of hand sanitizer, it is advisable to either stockpile it in advance or obtain the necessary ingredients to make it later. However, it is not recommended to rely solely on homemade hand sanitizer or alcoholic beverages, as these may not contain a high enough concentration of alcohol to effectively kill pathogens. In the aftermath of a disaster, finding the required 91% alcohol may prove difficult, underscoring the importance of being prepared ahead of time.</p>

							<p><strong>Water-Saving Bathing Techniques</strong></p>

							<p>We Americans have a bit of an obsession with bathing. We&#39;ve gone from the extreme of only bathing once a week to bathing every day. However, there are many places in the world where people don&#39;t bathe as often as we do.</p>

							<p>The biggest issue with bathing is the amount of water it requires. The average shower uses 10 to 25 gallons of water, and filling a bathtub for bathing takes 35 to 50 gallons. This can be a lot of water to haul from a nearby source or pump by hand from a well.</p>

							<p>Having traveled to Mexico and Colombia, where water is not always abundant, I have seen how people in these areas bathe. They use a five-gallon bucket to carry a couple of gallons of water into the bathroom. Then, they use a small plastic container, like a Cool Whip container, to wet themselves down, lather up, wash their hair (if they choose to do so), and rinse with the same container. Men, who typically have shorter hair, can get clean using less than a gallon of water this way, while women require more due to their longer hair.</p>

							<p>While this method of bathing may not be as satisfying as a long, hot shower, it can still effectively clean your body. Additionally, it is possible to keep yourself clean without washing your hair every day. Depending on how oily your scalp is, you may only need to wash your hair every two or three days.</p>

							<p>It is also important to note that the water used for bathing does not need to be clean enough for drinking. So, if you find yourself in a situation where clean water is scarce, you can still use available water sources for bathing purposes.</p>

							<p><strong>Clothes Washing</strong></p>

							<p>Washing clothes is a significant water-consuming task, particularly when done in a washing machine. However, in a scenario without running water or electricity, using a washing machine is not an option. One possible alternative is to place the clothes in the bottom of the shower and walk on them. But this may prove challenging if only a gallon or two of water is available for bathing.</p>

							<p>A more feasible option is to plug the shower drain, allowing water to accumulate in the tub for clothes washing. Additional water will only be needed for rinsing. Since only a few gallons of water are available at a time, clothes will need to be washed continuously, a little at a time, every time someone takes a bath. Despite the effort, it is still more practical than using up all the water just for laundry purposes.</p>

							<p>Without power, clothes will have to be hung on a clothesline outdoors to dry. It is important to avoid drying them indoors. Sun exposure will not only dry the clothes, but it will also aid in cleaning them by killing bacteria and other harmful pathogens.</p>

							<p><strong>Toilet Matters</strong></p>

							<p>If you are living without access to city water, it is likely that your city&#39;s wastewater system will also be out of order. In such a situation, if you are using the city sewage system, there will be no outlet for the drainage from your home. You will need to find an alternative solution to deal with the water from bathing and washing clothes. Additionally, you will need to find a way to replace your toilet.</p>

							<p>There are a few different options available to you. One of the easiest options is to use a five-gallon bucket toilet. You can purchase toilet seats that are specifically designed for use with a five-gallon bucket, which are ideal for survival situations. By placing a plastic bag inside the bucket to catch the waste, you can seal it and store it until the sewage treatment plant is operational again. To help the waste break down and minimize odors, adding lime (the mineral) to the bag before sealing it can be beneficial.</p>

							

							<p>An alternative approach is to use composting for the waste. Human waste has been utilized as fertilizer in some areas of the world for centuries. Composting toilets are available, which naturally compost human waste. However, if you&#39;re already composting for your garden, you can safely incorporate human and pet waste into the compost, even without a composting toilet.</p>

							<p>In a long-term survival situation, a five-gallon bucket toilet might not be sufficient, except if you&#39;re composting. Eventually, you&#39;ll need to address the issue of waste disposal. This is where outhouses come in handy. Although they may not be pleasant, they provide a secure and private location to deal with your waste.</p>

							<p>It is crucial to carefully select a location for your outhouse. It must be situated at least 100 feet away from any water source to prevent contamination. If you have a well, it&#39;s essential to avoid placing the outhouse near it. Moreover, it should not be situated uphill of any water source as waste from the outhouse could flow downhill and contaminate the water source. Additionally, it&#39;s recommended to keep the outhouse far enough from your house and your neighbors&#39; houses to minimize unpleasant odors.</p>

							<p>To break down the waste and keep odors at bay, adding lime (calcium hydroxide) to the contents of the outhouse is recommended. Lime can usually be purchased at a local feed store. Alternatively, wood ash can be used if lime is not available, though it&#39;s not as effective in eliminating odors. After each use, sprinkle one cup of lime or wood ash around the outhouse to cover the added content.</p>

							<p>For those who have septic systems, these concerns do not apply. A septic tank can last for several years before it needs to be emptied. However, it is important to have the tanks emptied on a regular basis to maximize capacity in the event of a disaster.</p>

							<p><strong>Maintaining a Tidy Living Environment In Your Home</strong></p>

							<p>Keeping your home clean is not only important for aesthetic purposes but also for preventing diseases caused by pests. Dirt and food crumbs are a magnet for pests, and these pests can carry diseases that can be transmitted to humans. Therefore, it&#39;s essential to maintain a clean environment to avoid inviting pests into your home.</p>

							<p>To clean your home, you can reuse the water you used for bathing and washing your clothes, especially for cleaning the floor. Since the water used for cleaning the floor is not clean, using the same water from bathing and washing clothes won&#39;t make much of a difference. It&#39;s important to keep in mind that water conservation is vital during emergency situations.</p>

							<p>Stocking up on cleaning products and sanitizers is an essential part of being prepared for emergencies. You should have enough supplies of cleaning products and rotate them regularly to ensure that they are not expired. It&#39;s also important to stock up on plastic bags to dispose of waste, such as food scraps and used tissues, properly.</p>

							<p>In conclusion, maintaining cleanliness in your home is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases caused by pests. Reusing water and having sufficient stocks of cleaning products and plastic bags are simple yet effective ways to ensure a clean and safe environment during emergencies.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY</strong></p>

							<p>During times of unrest, such as those caused by disasters, crime tends to increase. We&#39;ve all heard about looting and other criminal activities that take place in the wake of natural disasters. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the situation was so dire that the mayor had to institute a curfew and even confiscate firearms under martial law. While some people might see these measures as necessary, I don&#39;t agree with the mayor&#39;s actions.</p>

							<p>The fact is that crime rates tend to go up during times of crisis for several reasons. For one, law enforcement is often preoccupied with other pressing issues, which gives criminals an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. Additionally, many people may have evacuated their homes, leaving them unguarded and vulnerable to theft. Finally, desperate times may drive people who would not ordinarily break the law to do so in order to obtain the things they need to survive.</p>

							<p>The likelihood of people turning to crime after a disaster is largely dependent on the severity of the disaster and the desperation of the people affected. While some criminals will inevitably take advantage of the situation, ordinary people typically resort to crime only when they are in dire need. In such cases, essential resources are key. However, when people don&#39;t get what they need, there is always a chance that they may turn to violence. Some may band together and attack homes they believe have food, and these groups may be armed and willing to harm others.</p>

							<p>In such situations, relying solely on locks for home security may not be enough. Despite the benefits of locks, they cannot prevent determined intruders from breaking windows or kicking down doors. While there are steps you can take to enhance your home&#39;s security, they are somewhat limited, and defending your home may become necessary.</p>

							<p>You need to be armed and trained to use your guns to defend your home. Choosing the type of gun you want to own is a matter of personal preference, but you don&#39;t need a sniper rifle. Remember that using deadly force is only allowed in self-defense, so shooting someone who is a block away from you could be difficult to justify in court. For home defense, hunting guns are not recommended because they are too long for maneuvering inside your home. A pistol or tactical shotgun, preferably a bullpup design, would be more suitable. Stock up on plenty of ammunition for your chosen guns, with around 1,000 rounds for each caliber of rifle and 300 rounds of shotgun and pistol ammo for each gun.</p>

							<p>Your ability to use a firearm well is more important than the specific caliber or type of firearm you have. Crisis situations can impair your fine motor skills due to the spike in adrenaline, making it harder to maintain trigger control and shoot accurately. This means your shooting ability may be significantly worse during a home invasion, with a higher likelihood of missing your target. The risk of not hitting your target is that the bullet can continue through walls and potentially hit unintended objects or bystanders. Even a 9mm bullet can pass through multiple layers of plywood or brick walls. As the shooter, you are legally responsible for every bullet that leaves your gun, and hitting an innocent bystander can result in arrest and charges such as manslaughter. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial to avoid missing your intended target.</p>

							<p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong></p>

							<p>The key to accuracy in a crisis situation is practice. Shooting accurately is a skill that takes time to master. Once you have achieved accuracy, tactical training can be helpful in teaching you how to maneuver and shoot, choose priority targets, and avoid being shot. It is important to remain calm in order to control adrenaline. Many shooting ranges offer tactical shooting events that are competitive and require you to shoot under pressure. This type of training will help you to overcome the problem with adrenaline and prepare you to protect your home and family. Encouraging your survival team to train and practice is also important for their ability to protect you and your family.</p>

							<p><strong>Secret Hide Out</strong></p>

							<p>Safe rooms are often suggested as a solution to protect your home from attack, but are typically only found in the homes of the wealthy due to their high cost. These rooms are designed to be bulletproof and offer a place for the family to retreat to in times of danger. Safe rooms can be made using various materials, with most utilizing fiberglass or Spectra-shield panels and a specially designed steel door for ballistic protection. Alternatively, a safe room can be made from concrete, but it would require a basement or a cement slab to support the weight of the walls. While safe rooms can provide protection for a limited time, they are not a perfect solution. Without reliable police protection or communication, the family is essentially trapped. It is recommended to include an escape tunnel in the safe room and to store bug out bags and firearms for added security.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PART 3 - SURVIVING FOR THE LONG-HAUL</strong></p>

							<p>In this discussion, we have primarily focused on short-term survival situations that might last for a few months. Although we have touched on the idea of long-term survival, we have not delved into it in detail. Most preppers prioritize preparing for short-term situations before considering potential long-term scenarios.</p>

							<p>A long-term survival situation can refer to anything that lasts longer than a few months, but from a planning standpoint, it generally means anything that goes beyond a year. Essentially, it&#39;s any situation that lasts longer than the supplies in your stockpile can sustain you. Dealing with long-term survival requires self-sufficiency, which entails being able to grow your food and cater to your needs. Achieving this level of self-sufficiency can take a year or more, and growing all your food can even take several years.</p>

							<p>As Napoleon is quoted as saying, &quot;Then we should begin immediately&quot; when told his plan to plant trees beside all of France&#39;s major roads so that his troops could march in the shade. Although we should prioritize some other things first, it&#39;s wise to start preparing for long-term survival when possible. Some of the things we can do, such as growing our food, can even be beneficial in the present, even without any disaster happening.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;<strong>WHAT IS BUGGING IN/OUT? WHICH IS BETTER</strong></p>

							<p>When facing a survival situation, one of the biggest questions to consider is whether to bug out or bug in. In the past, the common philosophy was to bug out in response to a thermonuclear war. However, times have changed, and threats have evolved. While there is still a nuclear threat, it is expected to manifest as an EMP attack. In such a case, it may not be necessary to leave your home, and your chances of survival may be better if you stay home. Your home can act as a shelter for you and your family, and it also houses your stockpile of food and other supplies. However, there may come a time when you have to leave your home, as was the case for the people of Southeast Houston during Hurricane Harvey or the people of Paradise, California, during the Camp Fire. When to bug out is a unique decision based on each situation. City dwellers will likely need to bug out sooner than those living in rural areas.</p>

							<p>In the end, the decision to bug out or bug in should be based on what will give your family the greatest chance of survival. Bugging in is often the preferred option for most people as it is easier to survive in the safety of your own home, rather than trying to survive in the wilderness. However, if you own a cabin in the woods that has been prepared as a survival retreat, your chances of survival may be greater there. It&#39;s important to note that it&#39;s not advisable to rely on living off the land in a bug out scenario, as it&#39;s much harder to survive that way than most people realize. While it may have been possible in the past with more wild game and a lower human population, it&#39;s much more challenging today. Having a bug out plan is still important, but it&#39;s crucial to have a specific location in mind that can provide you with the necessary safety and supplies to survive.</p>

							<p><strong>Preparing Your Bug Out Bag</strong></p>

							<p>Being prepared for a potential bug out situation is crucial. This means having a bug out bag ready to go, which will provide you with the necessary survival gear and enough food to get you from your home to your survival retreat. Different people may have different ideas about what should be in their bug out bag, as it is a personal item that needs to be tailored to individual needs, the climate they are dealing with, and their own level of survival knowledge. Carrying gear that you don&#39;t know how to use is not helpful.</p>

							<p>At a minimum, a bug out bag should be able to provide the basic survival priorities that were discussed in chapter one. The website,<a href="http://www.ready.gov/" style="text-decoration:none"> <span style="color:#1155cc"><u>www.Ready.gov</u></a>, recommends that many people stock three days of mostly freeze-dried food in their bags. However, it is better to have more food than that. At a minimum, there should be enough food to get you to your survival retreat, where you should have a cache of food.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to have a well-equipped bug out bag that meets your individual needs. Here&#39;s an example of what I have in my bug out bag, which is built into a tactical backpack.</p>

							<p><strong>Refuge</strong></p>

							<p>For shelter, I carry&nbsp;</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">an <strong>ultra-light tarp</strong> that can be used to make a temporary shelter.&nbsp;</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">a <strong>tough rescue blanket</strong> that won&#39;t tear,&nbsp;</li>

							</ul>

							<p>Although heavier than most people&#39;s survival gear, this kit is perfect for me, as I have been into survival for many years. It includes everything I need to survive in the wilderness for more than a week, and I would augment my food supplies by fishing.</p>

							<p>However, one essential thing that is missing from my bug out bag is a first-aid kit. I have intentionally left it out because I plan to grab the first-aid kit that I keep in the trunk of my car. This kit is housed in a bag designed for a travel shave kit and contains enough supplies to take care of most trauma wounds.</p>

							<p><strong>Survival Hideout</strong></p>

							<p>There are some people who are choosing to avoid the need to bug out by buying land in the countryside and building their own home or survival retreat there. While some real estate companies are selling land specifically for preppers who want to live off the grid, this option requires a lot of money and a career change to work from the remote home.</p>

							<p>For those who can&#39;t afford to buy a cabin in the woods or live off the grid, there are other options. One such option is to find someone who lives outside of town and use their land as a base for a survival team. Alternatively, you could buy a piece of land in joint tenancy with your survival team to bring everyone together in one place.</p>

							<p>If these options aren&#39;t possible, finding a rural community where you could bug out to in case of a disaster is the next best option. However, it&#39;s important to integrate yourself into the community and build relationships with the locals before a disaster strikes. Renting a storage space and building a supply cache in the community can help establish your presence and give you a claim to the town, even if the roads are blocked.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>BARTERING/TRADING</strong></p>

							<p>Building a stockpile is a great way to ensure you have what you need during a disaster, but it&#39;s impossible to predict every situation and prepare perfectly. Even with years of studying and preparing to survive, there will always be things you miss, as I did during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

							<p>In a major disaster, cash money will likely lose its value. It may still be accepted initially, but as society breaks down, fewer places will accept it without a fully functioning government to back it up. A financial collapse, such as the one in Argentina in 1999, can also render money virtually worthless, leading people to turn to bartering.</p>

							<p>Bartering becomes a norm whenever people lose confidence in their government&#39;s ability to maintain the value of their currency. In such cases, it&#39;s important to have a stock of barter goods that you can use. These can be the same sorts of food and supplies you&#39;ve stockpiled for your family.</p>

							<p>However, it&#39;s important not to take from your family&#39;s stockpile to have trade goods. Instead, you should establish a separate stock of things you&#39;ll use for that purpose, over and above your family&#39;s needs. Additionally, you may want to stockpile a few things strictly for bartering, such as tobacco, alcohol, or coffee. These items are in high demand and can be valuable trade goods.</p>

							<p><strong>Bartering Mindlessly</strong></p>

							<p>When we think of bartering, we usually think of exchanging goods, but that&#39;s not the only thing you can trade. In a post-disaster situation, you&#39;re likely to have acquired a number of useful skills for your own survival. These skills can also be marketable. Sometimes, the person with the right skills is more valuable to the community than the person with something to sell. If you have the ability to make or do things that will help others survive, they may see you as someone to protect rather than someone to rob.</p>

							<p>In a post-disaster world, your survival skills could be as valuable as the physical goods you stockpile. Here are some examples of skills that could be in demand:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Blacksmithing: the art of forging and shaping metal objects</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Clothing repair: the ability to mend and alter clothing</li>

							<p><strong>How To Barter Like A Pro</strong></p>

							<p>In times of crisis, bartering can be dangerous and it&#39;s important to take precautions. To mitigate the danger, it&#39;s recommended not to do bartering at home unless it&#39;s with someone you already know. This is to prevent giving the impression that you have items at home that others might need, which could invite attacks. It&#39;s also advisable to take only what you need for bartering and not to take too much with you.</p>

							<p>Security is the number one watchword when bartering. It&#39;s recommended to go to a marketplace where other traders are present as this will offer some security. However, it&#39;s still important to take security measures from your own team. It&#39;s best to take security and have them watch from a short distance away so that nobody knows they are with you. This way, they can offer support and surprise attackers if someone tries to rob you. It&#39;s also important to take a circuitous route when going to and from the marketplace to ensure you&#39;re not followed, as someone might try to find out where you live.</p>

							<p>Fairness in your dealings with others is also essential. Even though you have the advantage, it&#39;s important not to press it too far. Resentment from people you&#39;re trading with could motivate them to become enemies instead of repeat customers. It&#39;s important to find a balance between what you think items are worth and what they think they&#39;re worth. The best trade is one in which both parties feel like they got a good deal. While not always possible, it&#39;s something to strive for.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SUSTAINABLE FOOD, SUSTAINABLE YOU!</strong></p>

							<p>It&#39;s not practical to stockpile enough food for an indefinite period of time, as even a 10-year supply is nearly impossible. Most people limit their stockpiles to about a year and focus on growing their own food instead. This approach is consistent with the history of human civilization, where farming eventually replaced hunting and gathering because it was more efficient. With farming, you can usually raise more food than you can hunt or gather.</p>

							<p>You don&#39;t need to start a full-blown farm to achieve this goal. Instead, you can focus on large-scale gardening and raising small animals. You may have read an article about someone who grew all their food in their backyard, and if they can do it, so can you.</p>

							<p>Some people claim that you can sustain yourself with a small vegetable garden, such as the concept of a &quot;four-foot garden&quot; that uses vertical gardening. However, it&#39;s not realistic to believe that such a small area can provide enough food for your needs. To grow all your own food, you&#39;ll likely need your entire backyard, and possibly even your front yard too.</p>

							<p>The key to success is starting small and gradually building your garden. If you&#39;re new to gardening, it takes time to learn how to grow plants effectively. I know this from personal experience, as I had to learn the hard way.</p>

							<p>Raised beds are often more effective than traditional gardening for most people. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is that you can grow more food in a raised bed compared to planting in rows. Additionally, you use less seed because you plant more intentionally, rather than just scattering seeds in a row.</p>

							<p>Here&#39;s an example: let&#39;s say you want to plant carrots. The seed packet may recommend planting them two inches apart. If you&#39;re planting them in rows, you would do that, but the rows would be a foot apart to leave space for walking. This wastes a lot of space. However, with a raised bed garden, you can plant the seeds two inches apart and put the rows two inches apart, allowing you to have six times as many rows of carrots in the same space.</p>

							<p>This concept can be applied even more effectively in other areas. Consider planting tomato plants, which typically require two feet of space between each plant. In a raised bed, you can optimize the space by planting complementary crops such as herbs, cucumbers, celery, onions, peas, or squash in the gaps between the tomato plants.</p>

							<p>Admittedly, creating pathways between the garden beds may reduce some space, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. With careful planning, the paths between the planting beds don&#39;t have to be very wide, and you can add ledges to the edges of your beds, providing a place to sit or keep your gardening tools while you work.</p>

							<p>Using raised beds has another crucial advantage, and that is the quality of the soil. Soil is the foundation of any successful garden as it provides essential nutrients and water to the plants. However, many of us have poor soil in our yards. By installing raised beds, you are compelled to bring in soil, and it&#39;s an opportunity to invest in good quality soil. This investment will pay off by yielding a bountiful harvest from your garden.</p>

							<p>When it comes to constructing the beds, you have various options. While I&#39;ve seen creative uses of old bathtubs, used tires, and milk jugs for planting, it&#39;s best to use treated lumber to create proper planting beds. This allows for efficient use of space, even though it may come at a slightly higher cost. Another option is using brick, but that requires additional effort.</p>

							<p>Don&#39;t forget to consider fruit trees in your garden planning. Keep in mind that not all types of fruit trees thrive in all climates. You&#39;ll need to carefully select trees that are suitable for your area. Some fruit trees require a certain number of freezing days to produce fruit, while others may not tolerate freezing temperatures. Consult with your local nursery to determine which fruit trees are best suited for your region.</p>

							<p><strong>Maximizing The Potential Of Your Garden</strong></p>

							<p>To maximize your garden&#39;s potential, it&#39;s essential to provide your plants with the appropriate care, including adequate nutrients and water. I recommend using an electronic moisture meter to monitor watering, but as you gain experience, you may be able to rely on your instincts. Remember, you don&#39;t need to use purified water; rainwater, stream or canal water, and even greywater from your home can be used for your garden, as plants aren&#39;t very particular about their water source.</p>

							<p>During normal times, most people prefer to use chemical fertilizers to &quot;feed&quot; their gardens. However, the writer prefers natural fertilizers, as they are more readily available during times of crisis. Composting is a great way to recycle garden scraps and table scraps into fertilizer for your garden. Composting breaks down plant fibers, releasing nutrients back into the soil. You can also add human or animal waste to your compost. Worms and bacteria do the actual work of breaking down the compost, which can take several months.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s recommended that compost should be added to your garden after harvest time, before winter sets in. This will give the worms time to work the compost into the soil, which will help prepare the garden beds for the next spring. During the growing season, some plants may need additional fertilization, which can be done with other types of fertilizers. Fish emulsion is one of the best fertilizers available and can be easily made at home. Collect leftovers from fish, chop them up fine with a blender, put them in a gallon jar of water, and set it in the sun. Shake the emulsion every few days for a month while the bacteria break it down.</p>

							<p>Fish emulsion is a potent fertilizer, so only a small amount is needed. However, be warned that it doesn&#39;t smell very good when you open the container.</p>

							<p>Using mycorrhizal fungi in your garden can be a great addition aside from fertilizers. This type of fungi forms a symbiotic relationship with the plant by attaching itself to the roots. In this way, both the plant and the fungi can help each other out. The fungi acts as an extension of the roots by bringing nutrients and water to the plant while the plant provides nutrients to the fungi.</p>

							<p>Initially, I used mycorrhizal fungi for my lawn in an area where I had difficulty growing grass. The grass had been cut too low and had been burned by the hot summer sun. Despite trying every other option, I decided to give the fungi a try. Within three weeks, the lawn was growing better in that spot than anywhere else. After experiencing its success in my lawn, I incorporated mycorrhizal fungi into my garden. It helped my plants grow faster and produce larger fruit.</p>

							<p><strong>Buy The Right Garden Seed</strong></p>

							<p>When purchasing seeds for your garden, it is important to select the appropriate type. This goes beyond simply choosing between carrots or tomatoes; you need to consider the specific variety of carrots or tomatoes. There are three primary classifications of seeds:</p>

							<p><strong>Heirloom seed</strong> refers to the original plant seed or seed that has been bred. These plants produce seeds that will grow the next year&#39;s crop.</p>

							<p><strong>Hybrid seed</strong> refers to artificially mixed strains of plants. These plants produce seeds that will grow, but the seed won&#39;t be the same thing as the parent plant.</p>

							<p><strong>GMO seed</strong> refers to genetically modified plants created in a laboratory. These plants produce sterile seeds, which won&#39;t grow.</p>

							<p>To ensure sustainability in a survival garden, it is advisable to use only heirloom seeds that produce plants whose seeds can be harvested and replanted the following year.</p>

							<p><strong>Protein Food</strong><br />
							Although growing vegetables is important for survival, it doesn&#39;t provide animal protein which is essential for a balanced diet. Depending on your location, you may need to raise animals to fulfill this need. However, in urban areas, it can be difficult to raise larger animals such as cattle, so your options may be limited.</p>

							<p><strong>Poultry</strong></p>

							<p>Raising chickens can be a simple solution for animal protein, as they are omnivorous and can eat almost anything. However, if you live in the city, your options may be limited. Generally, you can keep a few birds in your backyard, but roosters are usually not allowed due to noise restrictions. It is recommended to choose layer chickens that are bred to lay eggs rather than fryers bred for cooking. Layers will start providing eggs in about six months and will lay eggs two out of every three days. Therefore, six layer chickens can provide a family of four with one egg per person per day.</p>

							<p><strong>Bunnies</strong></p>

							<p>Bunnies reproduce rapidly and mature fast, making them a convenient source of protein. They can be nourished with vegetable scraps from your garden, which makes feeding them easy and cost-effective. If you don&#39;t have dogs, you could allow them to roam freely, but you must have a sturdy fence around your garden.</p>

							<p><strong>Seafood</strong></p>

							<p>Raising fish is a cost-effective and effortless process, especially if you choose tilapia. Tilapia fish can grow in any tank and clean the algae off the walls. By setting up a worm farm, you can produce enough food for your tilapia fish to eat. However, you should be cautious when selecting other types of fish since some require more space or the growing of feed fish. This can be more challenging than worm farming and will take up more space.</p>

							<p><strong>Food Preservation</strong></p>

							<p>To ensure that the food you grow is not wasted, it is crucial to learn how to preserve it. Eventually, the goal should be to produce enough food for your family&#39;s needs, whether for present or future times of crisis. This means that you need to know how to prevent spoilage of your harvest.</p>

							<p>Although there are various ways to preserve food, particularly for meat, which is the most difficult, there are three primary techniques that you should have at your disposal:</p>

							<ol>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Root Cellar - People used to store their food underground in root cellars before refrigeration or ice boxes. This method provides a consistent temperature of around 55&deg;F, which is cool enough to keep vegetables, especially root vegetables, from spoiling.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Canning - This is probably the best means of preserving wet food. The process of canning kills any bacteria in the food and seals it in a container, keeping bacteria, rodents, and insects out. Canning meat is more complex than canning vegetables, requiring a pressure canner, but the reusable jars make it a worthwhile investment.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal">Dehydrating - Dehydration is one of the oldest forms of food preservation, with dried grains found in the tombs of the pharaohs. Dehydration is particularly useful for drying vegetables and meat, which can be easily rehydrated for use in soups.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>It&#39;s worth noting that these preservation methods were used long before the advent of modern technology, including electricity. Therefore, they are particularly well-suited for situations where the power grid is down.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SUSTAINABLE ENERGY</strong></p>

							<p>Let&#39;s be honest, modern society heavily relies on electricity. From our daily gadgets&nbsp;to home appliances, electricity powers many things we use regularly. While we can&nbsp;technically survive without electricity, life would be much more convenient with it.&nbsp;You may hear people talking about going &quot;off-grid&quot; and generating all their own&nbsp;electricity. However, this is an extremely expensive undertaking. Don&#39;t fall for&nbsp;advertisements that claim you can switch to 100% solar power and never pay the&nbsp;power company again. While it&#39;s possible to generate enough electricity to sustain&nbsp;yourself, these advertisements can be misleading, and you&#39;ll likely still need to buy&nbsp;some electricity, which could cost more than they imply.</p>

							<p>A few years ago, I explored the idea of switching to 100% solar power, but was deterred by the initial cost of $60,000. The solar company presented me with a plan where I would buy enough solar panels to cover my average energy consumption, and then pay off the panels over a few years. The excess energy I produced would be sold to the power company and I could buy more when needed. However, there were a few issues with this plan. First, the power company would buy my electricity at wholesale prices but sell it back to me at retail prices. Additionally, solar panels only produce optimal energy for about eight hours per day, and require precise installation to ensure they are facing the sun, which is not always guaranteed by the installation company.</p>

							<p>Despite these issues, solar power can still be a viable means of producing electricity. It is simply important to avoid the big solar companies and their questionable deals.</p>

							<p>Although there are various methods of generating electricity, the most feasible options for home use are solar and wind power. One of the benefits of both of these methods is that they use renewable resources. However, it&#39;s important to note that producing the same amount of electricity as you currently use is unlikely, unless you&#39;re willing to invest a significant amount of money. Those who are successful in going off-grid tend to significantly reduce their electrical usage, with some individuals even eliminating their reliance on electricity entirely. It is possible to generate enough electricity using these methods, but it requires a significant amount of planning and adjustment to lifestyle.</p>

							<p>The main issue with solar power is that each panel generates a relatively small amount of electricity. To produce a significant amount of power, a large number of panels are needed. Moreover, the power generated by solar panels is intended for charging 12-volt DC batteries, while most home appliances require 120-volt AC power. In order to convert the 12 volts from the panels to 120 volts, the wattage output must be reduced by a factor of 10. Thus, if an 80-watt solar panel is used, the resulting power output would only be 8 watts at 120 volts, which is not much.</p>

							<p>Wind power is a more cost-effective option, providing greater power output per dollar spent, assuming that there is sufficient wind. Most wind turbines do not start producing usable electricity until wind speeds reach 10 MPH or more. Therefore, unless you have consistent winds of at least 10 MPH, wind turbines may not be a worthwhile investment.</p>

							<p>Since both wind and solar power are intermittent, the best course of action for most people is to invest in both as they are able. This way, they can ensure that they have at least some electrical power at all times. While it may not be enough to power everything, it will be sufficient for some essential appliances.</p>

							<p>It is important to note that the electrical power generated by solar or wind should not be used directly to power the appliances you need. Instead, it should be used to charge a battery bank. A battery bank is essentially a group of deep cycle batteries, similar to car batteries but designed to store more power, connected together in parallel. The more batteries you have, the more power you can store. To charge the batteries, you&#39;ll need a solar charge controller, which acts as a 12 volt DC battery charger. You&#39;ll also need a voltage inverter to boost the power to 120 volt AC, allowing you to use it when you need it.</p>

							<p>Calculating how many solar panels and batteries you need can be complex, but the basic idea is that you will need a lot of both to power any appliances. Even one solar panel and one battery can be used to charge your phone, tablet, and operate a radio. A slightly larger system could provide minimal lighting, especially if you use 12 volt LED lights. With a bigger system, you could run an energy-efficient refrigerator. However, if you want to light your whole home, run your furnace, or use your air conditioner, you will need a much larger system.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF COMMUNICATION WITHOUT USING THE INTERNET</strong></p>

							<p>Most forms of communication today rely on electricity, including print media which is produced on presses powered by electricity. The internet, which is the primary communication method today, is entirely electronic.</p>

							<p>But what happens when the power goes out? Typically, there is little to no communication for a few days. However, regulations require phone companies, internet service providers, and radio stations to have backup generators that kick in after UPS systems run out of battery power.</p>

							<p>The duration of continued communication depends on the amount of fuel available for these generators. In the event that the generators run out of fuel, refueling trucks may not be able to reach them, resulting in a complete communication blackout.</p>

							<p>During such a blackout, people will be unable to contact loved ones or obtain news. Alternative communication methods will be necessary.</p>

							<p><strong>Walkie Talkies</strong></p>

							<p>If you need to communicate over short distances, business-band walkie-talkies are a good option to consider. There are many brands available, but Motorola is one of the most popular. It&#39;s important to make sure the radios you choose have a range that meets your needs. Be cautious when reading the range stated in the product literature, as it&#39;s usually under ideal circumstances. It&#39;s wise to purchase radios with a longer range than you need and test them to ensure they are sufficient.</p>

							<p>These radios are powered by AA batteries, so it&#39;s a good idea to stock up on them. You may also want to consider rechargeable batteries, but keep in mind that they have a lower voltage than alkaline batteries, which means they will run out of power more quickly.</p>

							<p><strong>Amateur Radios</strong></p>

							<p>Obtaining a Ham Radio license is considered the ultimate in communication, as it offers some of the most reliable means of communication in the world. Many people believe that obtaining a Ham Radio license is difficult, but it has become much easier since the FCC dropped the requirement of learning Morse code to obtain a license. Instead, you must pass a test on radio propagation theory and regulations. Ham Radio operators in most cities offer classes to help you prepare for the test and provide the testing as well.</p>

							<p>Ham Radio operators are available in almost every country and have managed to get news out even during the worst times of crisis. For instance, when Admiral Byrd led his expedition to the South Pole, it was a Ham Radio operator who managed to stay in contact with him, much to the embarrassment of the Navy. During times of war, Ham Radio operators have been the means by which servicemen stationed abroad could talk to their families.</p>

							<p>Although the internet has replaced much of what the worldwide network of Hams used to do in modern times, the network is still in existence. In case other means of communication fail, Hams will still be operational, provided you have the equipment to communicate with them or listen in.</p>

							<p><strong>High Frequency Radio</strong><br />
							To tune into Ham Radio, one only needs a shortwave radio, with no need for a license for receiving. Thus, adding a shortwave radio to your survival kit or bug out bag is perfectly fine. However, during emergencies, reception may be erratic and locating a particular broadcast may require a lot of searching. To address this, it would be best to invest in a high-quality scanning radio, despite the higher cost. Such radios are easy to use and would prove to be a valuable addition to your gear.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>WHAT IF MEDICINE IS NOT AVAILABLE?</strong></p>

							<p>In Section 2, Chapter 12, I provided recommendations for creating a family first-aid kit and suggested stocking it with certain medicines. However, what happens if the survival situation extends beyond the availability of your medicines and there are no replacements to be found? This is where herbal medicine comes in.</p>

							<p>Herbal medicine has been the foundation of modern medicine. In fact, many of our current pharmaceuticals are either synthetic versions of naturally occurring substances or these substances harvested and purified for medicinal use. Although herbal medicine lacks the purification process available to large pharmaceutical companies, it does not mean that they are not effective. In fact, some herbal medicines are excellent and can be relied upon when conventional medicine is not available.</p>

							<p>I want to clarify one thing about herbal medicine. There are many fads that are marketed as herbal medicine, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m referring to. These fads make grand claims about being a cure-all for various ailments, much like the snake oil sold 150 years ago. They come and go, and they are not based on the longstanding wisdom and knowledge of herbal medicine that has been passed down for centuries.</p>

							<p>This wisdom has revealed that certain plants contain substances with medicinal properties. In fact, this knowledge gave rise to the modern pharmaceutical industry, which interestingly enough, often tries to discredit herbal medicine. Nonetheless, herbal medicine is still worth exploring.</p>

							<p>I am by no means an expert on herbal medicine, but I can offer a few tips. I suggest that you study this field further if you find it interesting. I am currently studying it myself in order to increase my own knowledge.</p>

							

							<p><strong>Eggs </strong>have high calcium in the shell, great for gardening and for treating leg cramps. The membrane inside the eggshell can be used as a natural bandage, sticking to the skin.</p>

							<p><strong>Spider&#39;s webs</strong> make excellent bandaging material, absorb blood, promote clotting, and stick to the skin.</p>

							<p><strong>White vinegar</strong> constricts arteries, helping to slow bleeding and promote clotting, and also functions as an antiseptic. Apple cider vinegar is an excellent antifungal, useful for treating scalp and skin irritations.</p>

							<p>Tea Tree Oil - This natural oil has numerous medicinal properties, such as analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic effects.</p>

							<p><strong>Garlic</strong> is a versatile herb that functions as an antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal. It can be applied topically or ingested.</p>

							<p><strong>Turmeric</strong> is known for its healing properties, such as helping with rheumatoid arthritis, skin cancer, small pox, chicken pox, healing of wounds, liver ailments, and urinary tract infections. It can be taken with garlic.</p>

							<p><strong>Cayenne pepper</strong> is an effective antibacterial and antifungal that also helps with healing. It can be used topically or mixed with water to lower blood pressure.</p>

							<p><strong>Salicin</strong> substance is similar to aspirin and can be found in jasmine, beans, peas, clover, and the inner bark of the willow tree.</p>

							<p><strong>Pain Relievers Plants</strong> such as turmeric, ginger, cat&#39;s claw, aloe vera, and wild lettuce can all help with pain relief. Wild lettuce has been compared to naturally-occurring morphine.</p>

							

							<p>There are numerous herbal medicines in nature that can be used for a variety of purposes. The most common way to take them is by making teas, but they can also be made into capsules, tinctures, and salves. It is important to find multi-purpose mixtures of herbal medicines that cover the types of situations that you are most likely to encounter and plant the necessary plants in your garden. It is best to start harvesting and preparing medicines now so that you will be familiar with using herbal medicine when the need arises.</p>

							<p>This is especially important for treating chronic conditions. For example, cayenne pepper can be useful for treating high blood pressure, which affects nearly half of the adult population. Turmeric can also be useful for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Having alternatives for these chronic conditions could be lifesaving in a post-disaster situation where medicines are difficult to come by.</p>

							<p><strong>Be Proactive</strong></p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to address any chronic health problems before a disaster strikes. Many chronic diseases, like type II diabetes and high blood pressure, are caused by poor diet and lack of exercise. Losing weight and staying active can help prevent or manage these conditions without relying on medication.</p>

							<p>Regular exercise is an essential part of preparation for survival situations. Our sedentary lifestyle leaves us ill-equipped for physical tasks, making it challenging to perform required survival tasks that require strength and stamina. For example, splitting wood is a demanding job that can take half a day or more. If you need to heat your home with wood, you may find yourself in a situation where you have to do it, so it&#39;s crucial to be physically prepared.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s also important to address any medical issues that require surgery or treatment. In a post-disaster world, surgeries like knee replacements won&#39;t be possible, even if the surgeon is available. It&#39;s better to take care of any medical issues that require surgery now, rather than wait until it&#39;s too late.</p>

							<p>In conclusion, it&#39;s best to be proactive about our health and physical condition. Taking care of chronic problems now can save us from a lot of pain and suffering in the future. By prioritizing our health and preparing ourselves physically, we&#39;ll be better equipped to face any survival situation that comes our way.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SURVIVING THE WILDERNESS</strong></p>

							<p>This book primarily focused on urban survival, which is a likely scenario for most of us. However, wilderness survival is also a possibility, such as when bugging out or when stranded in the wilderness due to a broken-down car. In such situations, having the appropriate equipment is crucial to survival.</p>

							<p>The first step in surviving any wilderness scenario is having the right equipment at your disposal. If you don&#39;t already have a bug out bag in your car, it&#39;s recommended that you keep something similar on hand. The author keeps extensive emergency bags in the trunks of all their vehicles, which can be used not only for survival situations but also for everyday problems. Although these emergency bags don&#39;t contain food or clothing like a bug out bag, they do have almost everything else that you would need in a survival situation.</p>

							<p>If you want to be prepared for basic survival situations, you should have at least these items with you:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A knife for cutting and preparing food or shelter.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A fire starter to create warmth, light and cook food.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A water bottle made of stainless steel to carry and store water.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A rain poncho to protect you from the elements and stay dry.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Emergency blankets to keep you warm when it&#39;s cold or wet.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A water filter to purify water from any source.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A flashlight with extra batteries to provide light during nighttime or low-light situations.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">A small first-aid kit for treating injuries or wounds.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Duct tape which can be used for fixing and patching various items.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>If you find yourself lost in the woods and potentially injured, you may be in a survival situation. In this case, what should you do? Ideally, you would have informed someone of where you were going and when you expected to return. This way, if you don&#39;t come back, they can contact the authorities to begin a search and rescue operation.</p>

							<p>Given this, your best course of action may be to stay where you are rather than attempting to find your way out on your own. This is particularly true if you are injured or otherwise unable to navigate effectively. By staying in one place, you increase the likelihood that search and rescue teams will be able to locate you. In the meantime, you should focus on conserving your energy and staying hydrated. If you have the necessary supplies, you can build a shelter and start a fire to keep warm. If you do not have these items, you should prioritize finding or creating them. Above all, remain calm and avoid taking unnecessary risks that could make your situation worse.</p>

							<p>ssuming you didn&#39;t inform anyone of your whereabouts and you&#39;re lost in the wilderness, your only option is to make your way back to civilization. In such a scenario, if the GPS on your phone isn&#39;t working and you&#39;re unsure of your location, heading downhill is the best course of action. Typically, roads are situated in valleys and following them will eventually lead you to civilization. However, it&#39;s advisable not to travel at night. Traveling in the wilderness during the night increases your chances of hypothermia, and it&#39;s also hazardous due to the potential for accidents.</p>

							<p>Please note that hypothermia can occur even in temperatures that are not particularly cold. If the temperature outside is below your body temperature of 98.6&deg;F, your body will be losing heat. Additionally, if it&#39;s raining, the wind is blowing, or your clothes get wet, you will likely be losing heat faster than your body can produce it. Your body temperature doesn&#39;t have to drop much before you start experiencing confusion and disorientation, which can make it difficult to take care of yourself in a survival situation.</p>

							<p>To prevent hypothermia, it&#39;s a good idea to stop and set up camp about two hours before sundown. You don&#39;t need a watch or even knowledge of the exact time of sunset to determine when this is - simply lay your hand horizontally on the horizon at arm&#39;s length. Each finger width that the sun is above the horizon represents roughly 15 minutes of daylight left. When the sun is two hand widths above the horizon, it&#39;s time to stop traveling and start preparing your camp.</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Firewood: You&#39;ll need enough firewood to last you through the night. Make sure to gather a sufficient amount before starting a fire.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Starting a fire: Starting a fire is important for warmth, cooking, and to signal for help. Make sure you have the necessary tools to start a fire, such as matches or a lighter, and that you know how to properly build a fire.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Building a shelter: A shelter is important to protect you from the elements and to help regulate your body temperature. You can use natural materials, such as branches and leaves, to construct a shelter, or use a tarp or emergency blanket if you have one.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>When setting up camp, there&#39;s no need to worry about finding a water source as it can be found during the daytime while traveling. It&#39;s not recommended to set up camp near a water source, as it&#39;s also used by animals. However, camping near a water source can deter animals from using it.</p>

							<p><strong>Survival Shelters in the Wilderness</strong></p>

							<p>It is advisable that you have some shelter-building equipment with you, even if you don&#39;t have a tent. However, before using your supplies, it is best to check the resources that nature has to offer. Nature has many things that can provide shelter or partial shelter. Combining them with your equipment can make a comfortable place to spend the night. In the wild, shelter is primarily for protection against wind and rain. If you have these two things covered, you have a good chance of keeping warm enough to survive. A campfire will improve your chances even further.</p>

							<p>What are some natural shelter options to look for in the wild?</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Caves &ndash; natural formations in the earth that can offer shelter, just make sure they are unoccupied before using them.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Rock outcroppings &ndash; areas where rocks protrude from the ground, may not offer full shelter but can provide partial coverage from wind and rain.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Thickets of trees &ndash; dense areas of trees where you can often find small openings to create a shelter.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Overhanging embankments &ndash; cliffs or hills that provide a natural overhang for protection, but be cautious of potential water flow if it rains.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Deadfall tree &ndash; a fallen tree that can be used as the basis for a shelter by clearing out branches underneath.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Large pine tree &ndash; even though the bottom branches may touch the ground, there is often space close to the trunk that can be used for shelter.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>In some instances, natural resources may only offer you partial shelter. To make up for this, you will need to enhance it by using an emergency blanket or poncho to close off gaps or weaving branches to fill in openings. Keep in mind that you&#39;re not trying to create a luxurious accommodation but instead, you&#39;re aiming to protect yourself from the wind and rain.</p>

							<p><strong>Finding Water</strong></p>

							<p>When traveling during the day in the wilderness, finding a source of water is crucial. It is essential to drink at least 64 oz. of water per day, more if it is hot and you are sweating. To find water, traveling downhill is an excellent direction since water always flows downhill. Observing for signs of water as you go, such as cracked mud in very arid areas, can help. Checking the plants can also help since areas with greater green will indicate where water is more likely to occur. Even in arid lands, trees marking a watercourse can be found.</p>

							<p>Intermittent watercourses may still lead to water, and they all lead to streams, rivers, or lakes. Finding a pool or an area of dried, cracked mud, where there was a pool, might produce a seep where there is water. Animal trails can also lead to water since almost all animals need water, and they usually go to water early in the morning and at dusk.</p>

							<p>It is crucial to purify any water found in the wilderness before drinking it. Assume that any water you find is suspect and don&#39;t drink it unless it is purified first. You can purify water using a water filter or boiling it in a water bottle. Stainless steel bottles are recommended since they can be put in the fire to purify water.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

							<p>Preparing for a disaster is not just a task, but a lifestyle that needs to be lived. Each section in this book is just a start and can be further explored. As you work through the information, you will find yourself researching deeper and learning more to add to your knowledge. Completing each prepping project will lead to another, making you more self-sufficient and better prepared to face life&#39;s challenges. Even though it is uncertain when you will use this knowledge, it will become an integral part of you.</p>

							<p>Moreover, you will notice a positive change in your way of living. The preparation and knowledge gained will assist you in dealing with daily life challenges, like taking care of your children&#39;s injuries or purifying water. Your family will also benefit from the changes in you.</p>

							<p>This journey has a purpose, so don&#39;t look back. You will become a better person as you gain confidence and understanding. You will be able to reach higher, climb farther, and run faster. So, enjoy the ride!</p>

							<!-- Section Content-->
							<p>Have you ever experienced the feeling that life is difficult and challenging? Does it seem like a struggle just to get out of bed in the morning and accomplish all of the tasks that need to be done? Do you wake up feeling constantly fatigued and stressed, and wonder if life is too much to handle?</p>

							<p>It&#39;s understandable to feel this way, with work piling up and financial struggles weighing heavily. Perhaps you&#39;re feeling physically unwell due to a shopping spree or a stomach ache. However, it&#39;s worth reflecting on the mindset of a true warrior in comparison.</p>

							<p>Imagine someone who sleeps on the streets, uncertain whether they will survive the night. Upon waking, they have no time for a shower or a decent breakfast, and must immediately leap into action. They ignore their wounds, take lives, and witness their comrades being killed before their eyes.</p>

							<p>Yet, despite all this, we might still complain about feeling tired and overworked after finishing a 9-to-5 shift. This perspective is not to belittle the difficulties of everyday life, but to acknowledge that there are others out there who face even greater hardships.</p>

							<p>Many people struggle with serious illnesses and are unable to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, they carry themselves with grace, dignity, and bravery that puts the rest of us to shame.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to note that the warrior mindset is not necessarily related to combat. The individuals who start bar fights and engage in violent behavior are far from true warriors. Ask someone who has experienced real combat whether they would want to risk their health and energy on starting unnecessary fights.</p>

							<p>The warrior mindset is about knowing what you want and striving to achieve it. It requires resilience and the ability to overcome obstacles without letting minor setbacks get in the way. It involves persevering with what you know is right, taking responsibility, and carrying the weight of hardship with dignity and pride.</p>

							<p>The warrior mindset also means not being ruled by emotions and resisting the temptation to choose easy solutions to problems. By embodying this mentality, you can face life&#39;s challenges with greater fortitude and grace.</p>

							<p><strong>Definition Of This Mindset</strong></p>

							<p>The warrior mindset is all about having the determination to know what you want and to go for it. It is about having the strength to not let little things get you down, to push ahead with what you believe is right, and to carry responsibility and hardship on your shoulders with dignity and pride. It is also about not letting your emotions get the better of you and not taking the easy way out when faced with problems.</p>

							<p>The concept of the warrior&#39;s mindset comes from our romanticized image of warriors and their heroic deeds throughout history. Although not every warrior fits this image of heroism, there are individuals who manage to stay calm and cool under pressure, forging ahead without allowing small inconveniences or a lack of creature comforts to stand in their way.</p>

							<p>The point is that if we can take this same mindset and apply it to modern life, we can become unstoppable and bulletproof. Our enemies would be unable to stop us, and our career, relationship, and financial goals would all crumble before our will.</p>

							<p>The traits of self-discipline, determination, and self-sufficiency are essential for us to become strong individuals and to live a fulfilling life. They help us become good parents, friends, and partners and earn respect and admiration from others.</p>

							<p>Developing a warrior&#39;s mindset is like a workout for our minds, philosophy, and souls. It is about having mental strength and being able to face life&#39;s challenges without faltering. With a warrior&#39;s mindset, even the smallest obstacles can be overcome with ease, and we become unstoppable.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>THE GOAL - QUALITIES OF A TRUE WARRIOR</strong></p>

							<p>Here are some characteristics that describe the warrior mindset:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Courageous: Willing to face danger, difficulty, or pain without fear.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Self-Disciplined: Able to control one&#39;s behavior, emotions, and impulses to achieve goals.</li>

							</ul>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p>>To cultivate the traits of a true warrior, this book aims to help readers better understand and embody qualities like self-discipline, courage, responsibility, and more. The Disney film Mulan offers a surprisingly apt description of a warrior, particularly in the song &quot;I&#39;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot; (which Jackie Chan sang in the Chinese version). The lyrics emphasize the importance of being tranquil yet powerful, swift yet forceful, and still yet determined, reflecting the inner strength and purpose that drive a warrior forward. The warrior spirit resists outside pressures and perseveres through adversity.</p>

							<p><strong>Moments of Weakness</strong></p>

							<p>>Living on a battlefield is unlikely, and hopefully, you will never have to experience combat. However, the warrior mindset can be applied in various aspects of your daily life. You can demonstrate what it takes to be a warrior in numerous opportunities. It is crucial to reflect on those moments when you were not a warrior due to fear, anger, lack of motivation, or willpower. It is worth considering:</p>

							<p>>&bull; Favorite shirt torn: Let small inconveniences ruin your day and affect others.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Rainy day cancellation: Cancel plans with friend due to inconvenience.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Weight loss setback: Succumb to temptation and undermine weight loss goals.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Fainting friend: Panic and make matters worse instead of calmly following protocol.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Rushed work: Put in less effort and rush through an assignment due to resentment and fatigue.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Broken dreams: Fail to pursue your dreams and opt for mindless TV instead.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Dishonesty: Blame others for your mistakes and deceive your partner.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Abandoning others: Leave friends or family behind in a dangerous situation.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Lack of courtesy: Push ahead of an elderly person in line.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Peer pressure: Succumb to peer pressure and engage in activities you have no interest in.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Infidelity: Give in to momentary impulses and cheat on your partner, hurting loved ones.</p>

							<p>>&bull; Unfulfilling situation: Stay in a job or relationship despite being unhappy.</p>

							<p>>While some of the examples may be more severe than others, they all stem from the same root cause: weakness. Although there is a significant difference between indulging in ice cream when you should not and being influenced by hate speech, weakness is the common factor. Giving in to things we know are wrong and making excuses to delay our goals are both consequences of weakness. Weakness is frequently the origin of our difficulties and can even be the root of evil. While it is natural to occasionally lose our composure, it is important to recognize and overcome our weaknesses to lead a fulfilling life.</p>

							<p>>A strong person&#39;s approach to common issues:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Shirt is torn - Wear something else, recognize it&#39;s a small issue</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Rainy day - Do what&#39;s right, go out</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Low energy for weight loss - Find motivation and go to the gym</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Friend faints - Stay calm, assign tasks, check on friend</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Resent work - Do it to the best of your ability and communicate with boss</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Dream of writing a book - Set small goals to achieve it</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Break a glass - Own up and face the consequences</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Physical altercation - Ensure safety and calm situation</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Getting on train - Let others on first, show respect</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Peer pressure to smoke - Make own choice, do what feels right</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Attractive person advances - Control feelings and remain faithful</li>

							<p>>The warrior is a symbol of mental and physical strength. They possess a strong sense of ethics and have a clear vision for a better future. Unlike those who prioritize short-term satisfaction, warriors are willing to make sacrifices to achieve their goals. By staying true to their beliefs and commitments, warriors experience greater happiness, peace, and pride.</p>

							<p>>This sense of fulfillment is not limited to the warrior alone. Others are inspired by their example and benefit from their actions. By striving for something greater than themselves, warriors become leaders and positive forces in their communities. Their strength and determination inspire those around them to also strive for excellence and to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

							<p>>In essence, the warrior&#39;s approach to life is one of selflessness and purpose. They prioritize the greater good over personal gain, and are willing to face challenges and adversity in pursuit of their goals. Through their example, they inspire others to do the same and create a better future for all.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>INNER DRIVE</strong></p>

							<p>>The warrior mindset is defined by the &#39;fire within&#39;, a powerful phrase that reflects their mental and physical strength. It brings to mind the lyrics from Survivor&#39;s song &#39;Hearts on Fire&#39;, where a warrior&#39;s code demands no surrender, and their spirit never gives up. Warriors do not quit or compromise their values. To develop this kind of unyielding will and determination, one must have a clear set of personal principles and a definite goal. As Alice Cooper and Xzibit put it, if you do not stand for something, you will fall for anything. Without a clear set of values and a defined purpose, it becomes challenging to stick to one&#39;s principles.</p>

							<p>>The journey to self-discovery is not an easy one, but it&#39;s essential if you want to live a fulfilling life. It involves understanding your core values, beliefs, and interests. Without knowing who you are, it&#39;s easy to fall into the trap of mindlessly following the crowd or getting sidetracked by distractions.</p>

							<p>>Having a clear sense of identity and purpose provides the motivation and energy to pursue your goals relentlessly. Take successful figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dwayne Johnson, for example. Their tireless energy stems from a crystal-clear vision of what they want to achieve. They have a burning desire that fuels them to get up every single day and work towards their goals with unwavering focus.</p>

							<p>>Arnie himself attests to the power of a burning desire. In his own words, &quot;I felt there was more to life than plodding through a normal existence... I wanted to do something special, to be recognized as the best.&quot; This burning desire is what enabled him to put all his energy into bodybuilding and become one of the most successful bodybuilders of all time.</p>

							<p>>The point is, having a clear sense of identity and purpose is what drives people to greatness. Whether it&#39;s striving for what&#39;s best for your family, achieving creative accomplishments, or reaching a particular point in your career, knowing what you want from life will fuel you with the energy and determination to make it happen.</p>

							<p>>When you become a new parent, you may notice that you have seemingly endless energy and will sacrifice your own needs to look after your children. This is because you have found something greater than yourself that motivates you to do your best. However, relying solely on your love for your family may not be enough to achieve your goals and build a better world for them and your friends.</p>

							<p>>To accomplish the most and achieve your objectives, you need to have a purpose and a goal that is intrinsically motivating to you. This means that you need to find a reason to get out of bed and avoid distractions and unhelpful desires, even when no one else needs you. Once you find your goal, you will discover your passion and endless energy and drive, which will make you speak with more conviction and greater charisma.</p>

							<p>>When you&#39;re passionate about something, you gesticulate more when you speak about it, and your body language is congruent with what you&#39;re saying. People will see that and rate you as more charismatic, inspiring, and better leaders. You will be more efficient at getting others to believe what you&#39;re saying, which is how movements are started and what makes you more attractive and magnetic.</p>

							<p>>With your goal and objective, you will be better equipped to make decisions and avoid unnecessary distractions. You will be more decisive and impressive because you can consider every decision through the lens of whether it helps you achieve your goals. For example, when choosing a career path, you should pick one that helps you achieve your overarching goals. Similarly, when deciding which political party to vote for, you should choose the one that helps you fulfill your vision.</p>

							<p><strong>Achieving Goals with the Mindset of a Warrior</strong></p>

							<p>>The importance of having a goal is to have something that is worth fighting for and is greater than oneself. This kind of single-mindedness has been the central psychology of history&#39;s greatest warriors but in a different form. Samurai and knights, for instance, had a great sense of loyalty to their master, and they would be willing to die for them. In modern times, blindly following a leader or a set of beliefs can lead to terrible consequences; thus, we must create our own values and principles to live by.</p>

							<p>>To achieve this, we need to create a goal or a vision to strive for, which can be changed, but we must never allow others to force us to act against our code. However, there is no objectively &quot;correct&quot; way to approach life because we don&#39;t know the reason why reality exists, what is waiting for us on the other side, or what the meaning of life is. Therefore, it is up to each individual to make their own way by evaluating their values, principles, and rules to live by.</p>

							<p><strong>Do You Have A Goal?</strong></p>

Therefore, it is up to each individual to make their own way by evaluating their values, principles, and rules to live by.</p>

							<p><strong>Discovering Your Purpose</strong></p>

							<p>>To begin the journey of self-improvement, one must first find a goal, a purpose that is greater than oneself to strive toward. This goal should be something that you are passionate about, something that will give you the fuel and the fire to keep going no matter what obstacles come your way.</p>

							<p>>Your goal can be anything, there is no right or wrong answer. It could be as grand as changing the world for the better, such as putting an end to world hunger or slowing down global warming. Or it could be something more personal, like becoming a rock star or achieving financial stability.</p>

							<p>>To find your goal, start by visualizing the life you want to lead 5 or 10 years from now. Picture where you want to be, who you are with, and what you have accomplished. This vision should excite and energize you, motivating you to pursue change and greatness.</p>

							<p>>Reflect on the happiest times in your life, your childhood dreams, and the people you admire. These can all provide inspiration and guidance in discovering your ultimate goal.</p>

							<p>>Once you have identified your goal, break it down into smaller, more measurable steps. These goals should be achievable and realistic, but still challenging enough to push you outside of your comfort zone. By structuring your goals in this way, you will be able to track your progress and stay motivated as you work toward your ultimate vision.</p>

							<p><strong>Creating Your Own Code of Ethics</strong></p>

							<p>>Creating your own code of ethics is an important aspect of living a purposeful life. It involves defining your own values and principles for living, rather than simply following societal norms or laws. These values should be based on what you believe to be the right way to live and what makes you happiest.</p>

							<p>>Ayn Rand, a well-known philosopher, believed that morality should come from what makes an individual happiest. She argued that man does not have an automatic code of survival and must choose his own actions and goals based on what is proper for a human being. In other words, people should pursue what they love, improve themselves, and protect those they care about in order to contribute to society and find happiness.</p>

							<p>>However, creating your own code of ethics doesn&#39;t necessarily mean following a specific philosopher or ideology. It is a personal process that involves examining your own experiences, beliefs, and values to determine what is important to you. This may involve questioning societal norms and laws that you don&#39;t agree with, and identifying what truly makes you happy and fulfilled.</p>

							<p>>It&#39;s important to note that there is no objectively &quot;correct&quot; way to approach ethics or life in general. Each individual has their own unique set of experiences and beliefs that shape their worldview. The key is to create a code of ethics that is true to yourself and allows you to live a purposeful and fulfilling life.</p>

							<p>>To start, creating your own code of ethics is crucial in defining your own set of principles to live by. It doesn&#39;t have to be a conventional set of rules and it can be influenced by your own beliefs and values. Once you have established your code, commit to sticking to it as it will provide you with a clear sense of direction and help you navigate through life&#39;s challenges.</p>

							<p>>However, it is also important to recognize the need for evolution and adaptation in your ideas over time. This is why continuous learning and reassessment of your values are important. Sticking to one set of goals or principles indefinitely may become a lie, and it is important to reassess your beliefs to ensure they align with your evolving views.</p>

							<p>>Your code of conduct should be upheld, as it will make you a stronger, braver, and more impressive individual. Additionally, your personal code of ethics should align with your goals and political views, all while ensuring that you don&#39;t lose sight of the details and miss the trees for the forest.</p>

							<p>>Ultimately, this process of defining your code of ethics and committing to it will help you become a person who knows what they believe in and who knows themselves better. When you have a clear sense of direction and self-awareness, you will become a greater and more powerful individual.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>CONQUERING FEAR</strong></p>

							<p>>The archetype of a warrior often evokes images of someone who is fearless, brave, and courageous. They are the individuals who stand up against injustice, walk into the line of fire, and take on adversaries that are much stronger than them. However, in our personal lives, our battles take on different forms, such as fighting against illnesses, overcoming debt, or struggling to maintain a daily gym routine.</p>

							<p><strong>Utilizing Fear Setting</strong></p>

							<p>>Many self-help gurus recommend writing down your goals to better define and visualize them, but Tim Ferriss, in his book &quot;The 4 Hour Workweek,&quot; suggests doing the opposite with &quot;fear setting.&quot; While he doesn&#39;t discredit goal setting entirely, he argues that fear setting can be even more effective in helping people achieve their aims and lead a more fulfilling life.</p>

							<p>>Fear setting involves defining and listing the worst-case scenarios of a particular decision or action. By doing so, individuals can face their fears and gain a clearer understanding of the potential consequences of their choices. Ferriss believes that fear setting can help people take action and avoid stagnation, as it allows them to identify and confront the underlying fears that may be holding them back.</p>

							<p><strong>Definition of Fear Setting</strong></p>

							<p>>The concept of fear setting revolves around identifying the fears that are hindering your progress and confronting them head-on. Tim Ferriss suggests that once you&#39;ve done this exercise, you&#39;ll realize that many of your fears are baseless, allowing you to move past them. Typically, our fears revolve around irreversible negative outcomes, but the likelihood of such outcomes is much lower than we tend to believe.</p>

							<p>>To apply fear setting, you need to jot down the worst-case scenarios for pursuing your goals and develop a plan to cope with or reverse those situations. This process helps you identify potential obstacles and prepares you to overcome them, making it easier to achieve your objectives.</p>

							<p><strong>Example: Change of Career</strong></p>

							<p>>Let&#39;s consider the example of changing careers. This is a common desire for many people, yet the fear of potential repercussions can hold them back. However, by defining these fears, their impact can be minimized.</p>

							<p>>For instance, if you were to write down the worst possible outcomes of changing careers, they may include the following:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Failing to secure a new job after leaving your current one.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Being unable to pay your mortgage and having to move.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Upsetting your partner to the point where they decide to leave you.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Realizing that the new job you thought you wanted is actually worse than your previous one.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>Experiencing rejection from multiple job applications and damaging your ego in the process.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>>By identifying and acknowledging these fears, you can work on developing strategies to overcome them and move forward with your desired career change.</p>

							<p>>All of these concerns are valid, but by thinking about ways to manage risk and reduce the impacts of negative outcomes, you&#39;ll realize that your fears may not be as well-founded as you thought. For instance:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>You can start looking for jobs without leaving your current job to avoid the risk of unemployment. You don&#39;t have to tell anyone.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>This approach will also be viewed as less reckless in the eyes of your partner.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>&bull; Alternatively, you could talk to your boss about your issues and see if there are other roles within your organization.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>If you end up unemployed, you could ask your old boss to take your job back, work in a supermarket while you search for other work, rely on savings for a few months, or move back home with your parents.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>If your partner leaves you for trying to become happier, then you need to reconsider the relationship.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>If you don&#39;t like the job you find next, you will feel more confident about job hunting in the future.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">>If you struggle to get accepted anywhere, you can work on improving your interview skills, updating your CV, or seeking career guidance, all of which will be valuable experiences.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>>The worst-case scenarios listed earlier may not be as bad as they initially appear. It could just mean living off savings for a short while or taking a small step back before taking two steps forward. Besides, there are various ways to reduce the risk of negative outcomes, making it improbable to end up in such situations.</p>

							<p>>Another essential piece of advice from Tim Ferriss in The 4 Hour Workweek is to adopt a &quot;don&#39;t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness&quot; mentality. By following this mindset and identifying your fears, you can become a happier version of yourself and achieve much more.</p>

							<p><strong>Stoicism and the Mindset of a Warrior</strong></p>

							<p>>Tim Ferriss has been credited with unique and innovative ideas, but he attributes his inspiration to ancient philosophy, specifically the ideas of the ancient Stoics. Stoicism is a school of philosophy that dates back to the 3rd Century BC and was practiced by historical figures such as Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius.</p>

							<p>>Stoicism can be viewed as an early form of the &#39;warrior mindset&#39;, emphasizing mental toughness and resilience in the face of adversity. It encourages individuals to expect and accept things going wrong as a natural part of life. In fact, the term &#39;stoic&#39; is often used to describe someone who displays courage and bravery. So, what exactly are the principles of Stoicism?</p>

							<p><strong>The Benefits of Negative Thinking</strong></p>

							<p>>When we express doubt to someone about the success of our plans, we often receive the advice to be more optimistic. Society encourages us to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. The general consensus is that positivity is good and anything else is unacceptable. However, is this truly the best approach to our problems? Could it be harmful to be constantly blinded by optimism, leaving us susceptible to disappointment and caught off guard? Is a life full of sunshine and rainbows the antithesis of a warrior mindset? A warrior would accept and embrace the fact that life is difficult, and then toughen up to face it.</p>

							<p>>This is the viewpoint of the stoics, who make a strong case for pessimism. Stoicism, a philosophy dating back to the 3rd century BC and practiced by historical figures such as Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, is an early version of a warrior mindset. It emphasizes mental toughness and learning to expect and live with things going wrong. In fact, stoicism is often used to describe someone who is brave and courageous.</p>

							<p>>Therefore, the question is whether constantly expecting the best, without considering the potential for failure, is the best approach to life. Perhaps being pessimistic is a better way to prepare ourselves for the challenges that lie ahead. By acknowledging the possibility of negative outcomes, we can better prepare ourselves and minimize the impact of those outcomes. While society may push us to always look on the bright side, it&#39;s worth considering the benefits of being prepared for the worst.</p>

							<p><strong>The Key Tenets of Stoicism</strong></p>

							<p>>Stoicism, as a philosophy, encourages its followers to embrace negativity rather than ignoring it. According to the Stoics, hoping for good outcomes is dangerous because it leaves one unprepared for the possibility of negative events, leading to disappointment. Instead, the philosophy advocates for embracing gritty realism - acknowledging the negative aspects of life and accepting that a lot of it is outside of our control and is often unpleasant.</p>

							<p>>By accepting the reality of negative outcomes, the Stoics believed that individuals can prepare themselves mentally to face challenges and be better equipped to handle them. Stoicism teaches that instead of focusing on positive emotions like hope and happiness, it&#39;s better to focus on what we can control, which is our own thoughts and actions.</p>

							<p>>The central idea of Stoicism is to cultivate a mindset that is able to face adversity without being overwhelmed by it. This is achieved by recognizing the things that are outside of our control and focusing on what we can do to improve our situation. By embracing negative events and using them as a tool to prepare ourselves mentally, we become more resilient and better able to handle life&#39;s challenges.</p>

							<p><strong>Applying Stoicism</strong></p>

							<p>>The Stoics have a different approach to life than what most people are accustomed to. While many of us are taught to think positively and dream big, the Stoics take a more pragmatic approach. They believe that preparing for hardship is essential and that embracing challenges can lead to personal growth.</p>

							<p>>It may seem counterintuitive, but constantly expecting things to go our way can lead to disappointment and unhappiness. The Stoics, on the other hand, recognize that life is unpredictable and that not everything will work out as planned. By embracing this reality, they are better equipped to handle difficult situations when they arise.</p>

							<p>>So, how can one practically apply Stoicism to their own life? It starts by rejecting the notion that everything must be positive all the time. Instead, one should prepare for the storm and embrace the challenges that come their way. By doing so, they will develop a resilience that will serve them well in all aspects of life.</p>

							<p>>While this approach may not be as widely popular as the traditional &quot;think positive&quot; mentality, it offers a practical and realistic perspective that can help individuals navigate life&#39;s ups and downs.</p>

							<p><strong>Embracing Negative Visualization</strong></p>

							<p>>Stoicism suggests a technique called &quot;negative visualization&quot; that encourages individuals to focus on their fears rather than their goals. Instead of envisioning everything going according to plan, one should imagine the worst-case scenario and consider how they would cope if their fears were to come true.</p>

							<p>>By visualizing these worst-case scenarios, individuals can better prepare for them and develop a plan to deal with them if they arise. Often, the imagined scenario is not as terrible as one initially thought, and they can find ways to cope with the situation.</p>

							<p>>This technique helps to remove the fears that may be holding one back from achieving their goals. It allows individuals to acknowledge potential obstacles and address them proactively instead of ignoring them blindly.</p>

							<p>>Interestingly, this technique is similar to Tim Ferriss&#39;s Fear Setting technique, which has gained popularity in recent years. By practicing negative visualization, one can cultivate a sense of preparedness and resilience that can serve them well in all aspects of life.</p>

							<p><strong>Learn To Be Satisfied With The Most Basic And Affordable Provisions</strong></p>

							<p>>In one of his letters to Lucilius, Seneca suggested setting aside a certain number of days to live with the bare minimum of provisions, both in terms of food and clothing. This exercise challenges individuals to face their fears head-on and recognize that they can survive on very little.</p>

							<p>>The underlying idea behind this exercise is to cultivate a sense of detachment from material possessions. By living with the bare minimum, individuals learn that they do not need material possessions to be happy. This exercise also teaches individuals that they can handle their worst fears, which in turn helps them to fear less.</p>

							<p>>Decluttering and living a more minimalist life can lead to greater freedom and less fear. Possessions can weigh individuals down and limit their mobility. The more one owns, the more they have to lose, which can create a sense of fear. Detaching oneself from material possessions can help individuals focus on their goals and priorities.</p>

							<p>>Making choices that prioritize personal goals and responsibilities over material possessions is a sign of strength and discipline. Selling a TV or foregoing a vacation to pay off debt or pay for a child&#39;s education are examples of warrior-like choices that can help individuals cultivate a sense of detachment from material possessions. Ultimately, possessions are just things, and if individuals must sacrifice them to achieve their goals, they should be willing to do so.</p>

							<p><strong>Dress In Unattractive Clothing...</strong></p>

							<p>>Stoicism also suggests wearing unattractive clothes as a way to develop the mindset of not feeling ashamed. By wearing clothes that are not considered fashionable or attractive, you may draw attention from others, but this experience will teach you that their opinion does not matter. This is a critical aspect of the warrior mindset, where giving importance to others&#39; opinions leaves you vulnerable to peer pressure and vanity. At times, you need to sacrifice your reputation to accomplish what must be done. This is similar to the example of admitting to breaking the vase.</p>

							<p><strong>Expecting The Worst</strong></p>

							<p>>Stoicism suggests that when we curse in anger, we are actually exhibiting our own failing and stupidity. Reflect on the last time you swore with anger, it probably wasn&#39;t because of an expected event such as rain or debt. More likely, it was because of an unexpected incident, such as dropping something on your toe or breaking a valuable possession. The point here is that the anger arises from the element of surprise, not disappointment.</p>

							<p>>Therefore, if you experience anger, it suggests that you didn&#39;t anticipate what happened, which can be argued as your own fault. However, if you accept that unpleasant things happen, and sometimes things do not go as planned, then you will be mentally prepared for it and have no reason to be angry.</p>

							<p>>By adopting this perspective, when someone cheats on you or a service provider does not offer a good service, you will consider it as a normal part of life, just like the rain. This mindset will allow you to approach situations with greater emotional balance and deal with them more effectively.</p>

							<p><strong>Managing Your Response</strong></p>

							<p>>Stoicism is about acknowledging that you have limited control over reality while finding comfort in the fact that external factors cannot hurt you - only your reaction can. It is not possible to control what happens to you, but you can control your interpretation of events and what you make of them. Being mentally prepared for potential setbacks is an excellent example of putting this into practice. Alternatively, you may choose to take a step back and accept the consequences rather than fighting against circumstances that you cannot change. In upcoming chapters, we will delve into mindfulness and the ability to choose how you react to the world around you.</p>

							<p>>Simply by acknowledging that adversity is a part of life and it&#39;s up to you to manage it, you can start to feel more in control. Rocky Balboa is an excellent example of a modern stoic, and one of his famous quotes embodies the teachings of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. According to Rocky, life is brutal and unkind, and it will knock you down if you let it. However, the key to winning is not how hard you can hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.</p>

							<p>>In a book I wrote several years ago, a reckless character spoke a line that unexpectedly carried weight. The quote, &quot;Pain is just the universe testing your mettle,&quot; rings true in many ways. Pain and adversity are inevitable, but how we choose to react to them is what ultimately determines our character.</p>

							<p><strong>Those Who Fear Death Also Fear Life</strong></p>

							<p>>Living in fear of death can lead to a permanently cautious lifestyle, where risks are avoided and life is not lived to its fullest. However, the solution is not to ignore death. Instead, a stoic approach would be to come to terms with it and accept it as a reality. This mirrors the way that the Samurai approached their lives as well. In the book Code of the Samurai, Edo samurai Daidoji Yuzan is quoted as saying that a samurai must always keep in mind the fact that they have to die. By doing so, they can live in accordance with loyalty and filial duty, avoid many evils and adversities, and enjoy a long life while developing admirable qualities. It is important to remember your goals and vision, work toward them, stick to your code, and make a difference while focusing on what you leave behind. This might involve protecting your family even when it means putting yourself at risk or taking chances to pursue a bigger goal.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>DEVELOPING A MINDSET OF GROWTH</strong></p>

							<p>>In the previous chapter, we discussed the significance of conquering fear, including the fear of death. Likewise, it is crucial to have the willingness to face discomfort and minor hardships. How can one lose weight if they are afraid of going on a diet? How can one expect career growth if they avoid hard work? However, many of us find ourselves in this position. We are not ready to do things that we do not enjoy or tolerate tough situations. As a result, we have become increasingly feeble, which is affecting our overall happiness.</p>

							<p><strong>Why Are We Becoming Weaker And Weaker</strong></p>

							<p>>In modern society, we have become lazy, spoiled, and overly indulged. We are so accustomed to getting what we want when we want it that we find it harder than ever to put in effort when it&#39;s needed. Everything is disposable, and everything comes easily. We never have to wait. Hungry? Order a takeaway. Bored? Turn on the TV and laugh at someone falling over. Need information? Just ask Siri.</p>

							<p>>Being constantly indulged in whatever we want means that we feel absolutely distraught when things don&#39;t go our way. For example, we might feel upset if the shower doesn&#39;t heat up properly. This is in stark contrast to the challenges we would face in the wild. For instance, in the wild, we would have only had cold water to wash in. Eating would have required hunting or foraging in the rain while avoiding predators.</p>

							<p>>Consider your dog and compare it to a wolf. Your dog might be loving, loyal, and fun, but it is entirely dependent on you. It wouldn&#39;t survive a day in the wild, and it&#39;s certainly not a warrior like the wolf is. Why not? Because it has been domesticated. And that, my friend, is our problem as well.</p>

							<p>>We could be so much stronger and tougher &ndash; mentally and physically. But as we are, we&#39;re fat, lazy, and low on motivation. It&#39;s time to break out of this domesticated state and embrace the challenges that will make us stronger.</p>

							<p><strong>Be Tough</strong></p>

							<p>>When it comes to developing a tough mindset, the first step is to live with less. This idea was discussed in a previous post on Stoicism, and one effective way to accomplish it is through travel. This means staying in hostels rather than booking hotels at the last minute and packing only a few essential items.</p>

							<p>>The author has personal experience with this approach. They recall a trip to Europe where they only carried a backpack. While at a train station in Poland, they couldn&#39;t read the signposts and didn&#39;t know when the next train would arrive or even where they were. With no access to data roaming or 3G, they felt quite lost. Eventually, they found a small cafe where they were able to order tea with milk, which they appreciated immensely due to the cold weather.</p>

							<p>>Interestingly, the author still asks for tea in polystyrene cups to this day because it brings back memories of that moment. This experience taught them that even small things can bring great joy and that rewards and happiness can be found in every moment. One doesn&#39;t need everything to go perfectly to be content.</p>

							<p>>Moreover, when things go wrong, they create stories and help to develop strength. By pushing oneself to do without, it is possible to learn valuable lessons about finding joy in simple pleasures and building resilience.</p>

							<p><strong>Developing Mindset</strong></p>

							<p>>Maintaining a growth mindset at all times is a key point to remember. Every challenge that comes your way presents an opportunity to become stronger, smarter, and better. By facing these hardships, your life takes on greater purpose, and you become better equipped to handle similar challenges in the future.</p>

							<p>>Instead of being defeated by debt, view it as a challenge to overcome. Ask yourself how you can earn the money you need to get out of it and become a better person. Don&#39;t allow stress or anxiety to overwhelm you; use this opportunity to grow and prevent the situation from recurring. Don&#39;t worry about how others perceive you, and don&#39;t blame yourself for finding yourself in this situation.</p>

							<p>>Instead, take action and learn from it. You weren&#39;t good enough before, but now you have the opportunity to improve. Growth and challenge are things that the brain is wired for. We thrive when we are mentally and physically challenged, and this results in the production of hormones like dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor that keep us focused and help protect our brains as we age.</p>

							<p>>Rather than avoiding challenges, you should actively seek them out. During times of peace, you should prepare for battle by learning new skills and training your body.</p>

							<p><strong>Essential Tools For Growth And Resilience</strong></p>

							<p>>We&rsquo;ve discussed the warrior mindset and how it involves greater resilience, patience, calmness, and strength. But the real question is how to attain it. How do you gain that warrior mindset? By now, hopefully, you understand what the warrior mindset is and what it means in a broader context. But how can you overcome your weaknesses and urges to indulge in cake, relax, and take the easy options?</p>

							<p><strong>Contemplation</strong></p>

							<p>>Meditation is an essential tool for a modern warrior to cultivate the necessary resilience, hardiness, and sense of calm to react thoughtfully to emotions and feelings. Meditation involves concentrating the mind, emptying the brain of thoughts, and avoiding distracting impulses. This requires mental discipline and is ideal for training that discipline. Concentration is synonymous with discipline, making meditation an excellent tool to improve this skill.</p>

							<p>>Meditation also helps in distracting anxieties, urges, and desires. Mindful meditation teaches individuals to let thoughts drift by without affecting them, while transcendental meditation clears the mind entirely. This calming effect helps individuals gain control over their thoughts and actions, making them calmer and less prone to agitation. This, in turn, allows individuals to act in the most effective manner.</p>

							<p>>Meditation is also a great way to recharge one&#39;s batteries and gain more energy, enabling individuals to execute their plans effectively. Many successful people credit meditation for their endless energy, such as Seinfeld, who says that he would have continued doing his show if he had regularly practiced transcendental meditation. He credits TM for providing him with boundless energy, stating that it helps him sail through the day without feeling exhausted or burned out.</p>

							<p>>In conclusion, meditation is an incredible tool for transforming one&#39;s mindset and developing a warrior mindset. It helps cultivate discipline, distract from negative emotions and impulses, and recharge one&#39;s batteries to take on challenges effectively.</p>

							<p><strong>Deep Breathing</strong></p>

							<p>>Correct breathing is another tool that you can use to restore your composure and enter the warrior mindset at any time. This involves belly breathing, where you breathe from your diaphragm and take deep breaths. This has the ability to calm your nervous system and induce a state of relaxation and digestion, making it the ideal way to overcome anxiety.</p>

							<p><strong>Benefits Of Cold Showers</strong></p>

							<p>>Cold showers have a number of benefits, such as increasing your metabolism, boosting testosterone production, causing an adrenaline rush, and even strengthening your immune system. In other words, taking cold showers can actually be good for you and an excellent way to start your day.</p>

							<p>>However, it&#39;s important to note that cold showers can be extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant. The sudden shock to your system can be jarring and painful, making it the last thing you might want to do.</p>

							<p>>Despite the discomfort, this is precisely why cold showers are an ideal part of your warrior training. The act of taking a cold shower requires incredible mental discipline and willpower. If you can force yourself to endure the discomfort every day, then you can develop the mindset and toughness necessary to achieve just about anything.</p>

							<p>>As a fun fact, actor Hugh Jackman reportedly used cold showers as a way to get into the mind of his character Wolverine for the X-Men movies. If you&#39;re looking for inspiration to embrace the warrior mindset, following in his footsteps could be a good start.</p>

							<p><strong>The Synergy of Strength Training and Martial Arts</strong></p>

							<p>>Throughout history, warriors have shared a common trait: they are not only mentally tough but also physically tough. While this book has focused primarily on mental toughness, physical toughness is equally important. It provides the strength, resolve, and power to stand up for your values with confidence, should the need to fight arise.</p>

							<p>>However, it&#39;s important to note that being physically formidable can actually help you avoid the need to fight altogether. By cultivating physical toughness, you gain the ability to protect yourself and those you care about, which can help you navigate conflicts more effectively.</p>

							<p>>Both martial arts and weight lifting are great ways to develop physical toughness while also instilling self-discipline. By committing to a martial arts practice and hitting the gym three to four times a week, you increase your chances of success on your journey toward becoming a warrior.</p>

							<p>>As Socrates famously said, &quot;No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.&quot; In other words, developing physical toughness is not only important for becoming a warrior, but also for living a fulfilling life.</p>

							<p><strong>Adapting Classic Principles for Success in Business and Life</strong></p>

							<p>>At first, the idea of carrying copies of The Art of War seemed like a fashion statement for business people. Although many claimed it was relevant to business strategy, it appeared to be nothing more than a vanity project. How could a thousand-year-old text genuinely apply to the modern world of technology?</p>

							<p>>However, as the author began to practice the warrior mindset, they realized that the ancient text was highly relevant. While it might not teach someone how to use modern computer programs, the book&#39;s ideas and suggestions are timeless and can be applied in almost any situation.</p>

							<p>>If the advice was good enough to help warriors win wars with swords and arrows, surely it could be used to solve modern-day conflicts in the workplace. The author presents some of the best quotes and lessons from The Art of War that can inspire loyalty and productivity in the office.</p>

							<p>>Additionally, the author has included quotes from Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince, which was written as an instruction manual for an Italian prince to become an effective ruler. Although both texts were aimed at historical warriors and kings, they are now coveted by business professionals and relationship gurus.</p>

							<p>>This is a prime example of why the warrior mindset is still relevant today, and readers will see that the sentiments within the texts echo much of what has already been discussed.</p>

							<p><strong>Things To Learn From The Art Of War</strong></p>

							<p>>The quote &quot;There is No Instance of a Nation Benefiting From Prolonged Warfare&quot; emphasizes that prolonged conflict only results in mutual damage to both parties. This concept is referred to as a &quot;pyrrhic victory,&quot; named after a historical battle. Even if you win in the end, the damage to your reputation and resources will leave you with nothing but a Pyrrhic Victory. Therefore, it is advisable to seek ways to turn an opponent into an ally and find mutually beneficial solutions.</p>

							<p>>The warrior mindset is not about aggression and reaction, but rather being poised, forgiving, and powerful enough not to need to resort to physical force. As Sun Tsu said, &quot;the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.&quot; This quote holds significant relevance for modern warriors, especially in today&#39;s world.</p>

							<p>>In essence, the warrior chooses their battles wisely and seeks to subdue the enemy without the need for physical confrontation. This approach can lead to more productive and beneficial outcomes for both parties involved. By adopting the warrior mindset, one can achieve success while maintaining integrity, honor, and dignity.</p>

							<p><strong>Seizing Opportunities: The Key to Multiplying Them</strong></p>

							<p>>This excerpt highlights the direct application of The Art of War to business, particularly in the process of making investments, where opportunities multiply as they are seized through strategic and wise decision-making. It draws a parallel to how Arnold Schwarzenegger chose bodybuilding as a path to success, demonstrating the potential for significant results from simple starting points by making wise choices.</p>

							<p><strong>Know Thyself, Know Thy Enemy, Win Every Battle</strong></p>

							<p>>The phrase &quot;Opportunities multiply as they are seized&quot; perfectly describes the process of making investments. It emphasizes the importance of spending money in order to accumulate wealth, which is a concept that Arnold Schwarzenegger applied to his career in bodybuilding.</p>

							<p>>Knowing the enemy and knowing yourself is another important principle from The Art of War. This highlights the need for businesses to research their market and understand their own strengths and weaknesses. Sun Tsu also warns that if you are ignorant of either your enemy or yourself, your chances of winning are greatly reduced.</p>

							<p>>In addition to the workplace, knowing yourself is also important for personal growth. By understanding your own values and goals, you can create your own rules and objectives. The ideal employee is one who is not driven by ego and instead prioritizes the greater good. This echoes Seneca&#39;s philosophy on living with less.</p>

							<p>>Planning is a key part of achieving success. Before launching a product or service, it is essential to conduct thorough research and test the waters. This reflects the calm and calculated nature of a warrior, who does not rush into battle without careful consideration.</p>

							<p>>Overall, The Art of War offers timeless wisdom that can be applied to a variety of situations in business and in life. By adopting a warrior mindset, you can approach challenges with greater confidence, focus, and strategic thinking.</p>

							<p><strong>Learning from Machiavelli&#39;s Advice for Rulers</strong></p>

							<p>>The Prince offers several lessons that are still applicable in modern times. One of the key takeaways is the importance of adapting to change. To achieve constant success, one must be able to change their conduct with the times. This is particularly relevant for large organizations, as resting on one&#39;s laurels can lead to failure. It&#39;s crucial to always be thinking one step ahead and adapting to new situations.</p>

							<p>>Another lesson from The Prince is the idea that one should treat their subordinates well or crush them completely. Although this notion may not be acceptable in ethical business practices, the underlying message is to avoid making enemies and not to give them time to recover. The wise warrior should aim to please everyone and find mutually beneficial outcomes, but if conflict is necessary, then they should act with finality and decisiveness.</p>

							<p>>The book also emphasizes the importance of not wasting time on indecision. The wise warrior should act quickly and decisively, while the fool will delay and ultimately fail. Similarly, entrepreneurs must be able to recognize obstacles and opportunities and turn both to their advantage. The warrior mindset can be applied to any situation and is crucial for success.</p>

							<p>>In summary, The Prince offers timeless lessons that can still be applied to modern times. Adapting to change, treating others well, acting with decisiveness, and recognizing opportunities are just a few of the key takeaways. These books belong on every warrior&#39;s reading list, as they can help individuals on their journey to becoming the best version of themselves.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Choosing the Challenging Path</strong></p>

							<p>>Our journey together is coming to an end, but your journey is just beginning. It&#39;s time to step out of your comfort zone, face challenges, grow and determine what truly matters to you. Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff anymore and embrace a more demanding and challenging life because that&#39;s where true value lies, and that&#39;s what will make you great.</p>

							<p>>But before you embark on this new journey, here&#39;s a word of caution: it won&#39;t be easy. You may have to say things that people don&#39;t like, upset the status quo, be shunned for disregarding your appearance, and feel destitute at times for forsaking physical possessions. However, if you know yourself, your goals, and the principles you want to live by, then you&#39;ll know what the right things to do are, and you&#39;ll have the strength to do them. You must also be willing to face the consequences of your actions, which is the final lesson I want to impart upon you.</p>

							<p>>It&#39;s essential to be willing to take risks, face criticism, and handle the outcome of your decisions. This follows on from the lessons on stoicism, minimalism, and fear that we&#39;ve already discussed. Once you understand that making mistakes is a part of the learning process and can deal with the outcome, you&#39;ll become more efficient and decisive. On the other hand, people who are afraid of making mistakes and don&#39;t want to upset anyone will lack conviction and never be able to make decisions.</p>

							<p>>As a warrior, you must follow your own path, take ownership of your decisions, and face the consequences like a mature adult. You&#39;ll ask for forgiveness instead of permission, and even if you don&#39;t receive it, you&#39;ll continue to move forward because you&#39;ve done what&#39;s right for you. Remember, you are a warrior.</p>

							<p>>Imagine your home has been destroyed due to a flood, and you&#39;re left with nothing but your bug-out bag. Alternatively, a terrorist attack may occur near your location, making the area dangerous, and you need to evacuate to a safer place. In both cases, finding a new shelter becomes essential. However, the question arises: where do you go?</p>

							<p>>For many individuals, staying with friends or family could be an option. But if that&#39;s not feasible, finding a motel or hotel to stay in becomes a necessity. The situation becomes even more complex if you&#39;re abroad and need to locate a safe place during an emergency.</p>

							<p>>Selecting the wrong shelter could be more dangerous than staying where you are. A news story in the past mentioned a British tourist who jumped out of her hotel balcony in India to escape from a man who was harassing her.</p>

							<p>>This experience highlights the importance of being cautious and thoughtful when deciding on a place to stay. This article provides a few essential tips that can guide you in making a sound decision that not only ensures the safety of your belongings but could also save your life.</p>

							<p><strong>What The Area Should Be Like</strong></p>

							<p>>To ensure your safety, it&#39;s crucial to select a motel or hotel in an area that&#39;s relatively safe. Opting for a place located in a dangerous area that is notorious for crime, vagrancy, and other such unsavory activities could potentially put you in harm&#39;s way. Being in such an environment would increase the likelihood of you being accosted outside the hotel, and even your room might not be secure due to the presence of criminals lurking around.</p>

							<p><strong>Security Is Priority</strong></p>

							<p>>It&#39;s important to confirm whether your hotel or motel has security measures in place. However, it&#39;s crucial to keep in mind that this alone may not guarantee safety, particularly in countries where security personnel can be bribed. Additionally, it&#39;s advisable to check if security personnel are present at night, if CCTV cameras are installed to discourage criminals, and if the area is well-lit. These factors play a significant role in determining the safety of the location.</p>

							<p><strong>Ground Floor Is Not A Choice</strong></p>

							<p>>Opt for a hotel room on higher floors whenever possible. Choosing a motel room on the ground floor can make it easier for criminals to break in and rob or harm you.</p>

							<p><strong>Your Social Environment</strong></p>

							<p>>It&#39;s important to consider the type of guests that the hotel or motel attracts. While it&#39;s easy to assume that external threats are the only dangers, it&#39;s important to remember that sometimes the enemy can be within. Staying in a budget motel that attracts unsavory characters could put you at risk of theft or other crimes. On the other hand, staying in a high-end establishment where prominent people stay could make the place a potential target in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>

							<p><strong>Additional Tips</strong></p>

							<p>>In addition to the aforementioned points, it is crucial to exercise common sense when staying in an unfamiliar place. Refrain from giving out personal information, such as your room number, to strangers.</p>

							<p>>Familiarize yourself with all emergency exits in the building and know precisely where to go in case you need to make a swift escape. It is also advisable to locate the closest hospital and police station.</p>

							<p>>By following the tips provided above, you can ensure your safety. During a crisis, it is easy to become overwhelmed and make hasty decisions. However, it is essential to remain calm and make the right choices to guarantee your survival. Your life depends on it.</p>

							<p>In times of emergency, your level of control over the situation is directly linked to your level of proactivity. Reactive individuals tend to have lower awareness levels and can be taken by surprise when sudden acts of violence occur. Unfortunately, many people have fallen victim to crimes such as theft, rape, robbery, and murder simply because they were unaware of their surroundings. As a prepper, it&#39;s important to remember that if you&#39;re not actively looking for potential threats, you&#39;re unlikely to spot them before it&#39;s too late.</p>

							<p><strong>Remain Vigilant for Suspicious Activity</strong></p>

							<p>To increase your situational awareness, it&#39;s important to be vigilant for anything that appears suspicious or unusual. In times of crisis, crime rates tend to rise, and even during periods of peace, criminals are constantly on the lookout for easy targets. While it could be anyone who falls victim, you don&#39;t want it to be you.</p>

							<p>If you observe an unknown individual repeatedly walking past your house, take note and inform the authorities instead of assuming they&#39;re harmless. Even if they&#39;re dressed like a landscaper or someone who belongs in the neighborhood, there might be something wrong. They may be assessing your property and planning a break-in later. It&#39;s always better to err on the side of caution.</p>

							<p><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong></p>

							<p>Human beings are generally not violent by nature. Most people avoid confrontation and physical altercations because they do not want to cause harm or be harmed. However, there are some individuals who derive pleasure from inflicting pain. These individuals may suffer from anger management issues or mental illness.</p>

							<p>Adopting a pacifist approach and believing in the ideology of non-violence, as advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, may not always be the best course of action. Being too passive and not taking action to protect oneself can make one vulnerable to becoming a victim.</p>

							<p>For instance, if someone cuts you off while driving on the road, it may be tempting to engage in a physical altercation with them. However, it is important to remain calm and composed in such situations. Similarly, if a group of youths taunt you in public, it is best to walk away rather than trying to confront them.</p>

							<p>When in potentially dangerous situations, such as on a late-night bus ride with an unfamiliar person who seems suspicious, it is essential to remain vigilant and observe their behavior without drawing attention to yourself. Ignoring the situation by burying your head in a magazine or focusing on your phone could put you at risk.</p>

							<p><strong>Confidence Is Important</strong></p>

							<p>Merely projecting confidence and the appearance of strength is often sufficient to deter potential attackers. A person who walks with purpose, keeping an eye on their surroundings, exudes an air of capability. Criminals are more likely to avoid such an individual because they don&#39;t seem like an easy target. On the other hand, someone who shuffles timidly, holding a newspaper, a cup of coffee, and a phone, while trying to open their car door, sends out a clear signal that they&#39;re vulnerable to muggers. It&#39;s important to act confident and alert, even if you&#39;re feeling nervous, because how you present yourself can make a significant difference.</p>

							<p><strong>Educate Your Kids</strong></p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to educate your children on the dangers of trusting strangers. For instance, if someone calls the house claiming to conduct a survey and your child answers the phone, they should avoid disclosing if no adult is present or revealing details about the whereabouts of family members. Such callers could potentially be plotting to burglarize your home. It&#39;s also crucial to monitor your children&#39;s online activity and make sure they only interact with trusted individuals on the internet, as strangers they meet online may pose significant threats to their safety.</span></span></p>

							<p><strong>Exercise Caution When Trusting Others</strong></p>

							<p>Finally, it&#39;s crucial never to be too trusting. Offering help to someone in need, such as a stranded motorist, may lead to becoming a victim of a carjacking. Even confiding in your neighbors about storing emergency supplies can put you at risk of being targeted during a crisis. It&#39;s important to be mindful of what you disclose to others as there can be severe consequences. In summary, during a crisis, remaining extra vigilant and aware of your surroundings is key. Pay attention to your gut instincts as they will guide you to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Essentials</strong></p>

							<p>The strategies presented in this book are rooted in Jiu-Jitsu, which has been the foundation of many other martial arts and continues to be used by military and law enforcement personnel worldwide. While the origins of Jiu-Jitsu date back thousands of years, the strategies outlined in this book have been adapted to suit modern-day situations. Although there may be some variations in the execution of these strategies among individuals, they are all easy to learn and can be performed by people of all ages.</p>

							<p>To truly grasp the strategies presented in this book, it is important to repeat and teach them to others. This process allows for a deeper understanding of the concepts and prompts individuals to ask themselves important questions. It is important to take the time to fully absorb the concepts rather than rushing through to learn the next set of strategies.</p>

							<p>The system presented in this book is made up of various concepts that are easier to learn than memorizing a different strategy for each type of attack. Basic hitting and placing techniques are combined with fundamental breakaways to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of self-defense. By mastering these primary concepts, individuals will gain a solid foundation in self-defense.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s important to consider that the safety of your environment might change over time. Although you may currently feel safe and don&#39;t see the need for this type of book, the region you live in could be expanding with new people who bring in different thoughts and values. You may also travel for work or leisure to a new area where you are unfamiliar with the surroundings. Therefore, it is always useful to learn some fresh ideas and strategies. By opening your mind and looking at the situation from a wider point of view, you can be better prepared for the unforeseen.</p>

							<p>The strategies presented in this book are designed using Gross Motor Skills, which are basic body movements that are easy to learn and execute. This is a crucial factor to consider when learning self-defense strategies, as they must be simple enough to be performed under pressure.</p>

							<p>To truly internalize and become proficient in these strategies, it is recommended to practice them with family and friends. The more you practice, the more innate they will feel, and you will be better equipped to execute them effectively in real-life situations. It is also helpful to practice in different locations, such as the kitchen, bathroom, living room, or garage, to ensure that you are prepared to defend yourself in any environment.</p>

							<p>If you spend most of your time in small rooms or spaces, it&#39;s important not to limit your practice to the large open space of a gym. Instead, you need to practice in environments that are applicable to you.</p>

							<p>To be more aware of potential threats, it&#39;s helpful to know who your foe might be and learn to recognize their movements, even rituals that are common among certain types of attackers. Women, for instance, are more likely to encounter a different kind of attacker than men. Typically, women are more likely to face male attackers like muggers or rapists as opposed to other women.</p>

							<p>Understanding the attacker increases the likelihood of defeating them. Many of these individuals are deceptive, and often the bigger the crime, the bigger the deceit. Not all aggressors fit the stereotype of &quot;The Bad Guy,&quot; and domestic violence is unfortunately a common occurrence.</p>

							<p>Try not to get caught up in your own little bubble and be aware that there are people outside of your immediate circle. Whether we like it or not, there are people out there whose intentions are not always good. You may never encounter such people, but then again, you may or may have already. It could be at work, at home, on the street, in a bar, or even on the road. Don&#39;t let your guard down, as these are the types of individuals that predators seek.</p>

							<p>Bad things sometimes happen to good people, and it&#39;s important to acknowledge that it could happen to anyone, including you. I&#39;m not saying that it will, but it&#39;s a possibility. We hear about these incidents happening every day, and being aware that it&#39;s out there is a significant step.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Self-Defense Techniques for Escaping Dangerous Situations</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Escape</strong></p>

							<p>Self-protection is not just about mastering a few defensive tactics; it&#39;s also about incorporating safety measures into our daily routine to enhance our security. Most of it is common sense, while the rest of it is simply a matter of habit. Some things we do without even thinking about them, such as wearing a seatbelt, crossing the street safely, or using a knife properly. In the past, people had to be persuaded to wear seatbelts, but now it&#39;s second nature. This illustrates that repeated behavior can become a habit and ultimately feel like second nature.</p>

							<p><strong>Body Language</strong></p>

							<p>The way you carry yourself, such as looking down, slouching, hiding your hands in your pockets, and making yourself small, sends a message that you are weak and vulnerable. Women are often targeted as easy victims, so it is important to have strong body language to reduce the risk of being targeted. Make eye contact with people in a way that shows you have noticed them (potential criminals are less likely to act if they think they could be identified). When walking, swing your arms and take up space. Strong body language not only affects how others perceive you, but also boosts your own self-confidence. Just like predators in the wild, attackers on the streets do not go after the strongest or most unassailable prey, but rather the weak, injured, or isolated. Avoid putting yourself in situations that increase your vulnerability. Attackers are not looking for a fight, but an easy target, and when faced with fierce resistance, they often give up their attempt.</p>

							<p><strong>Verbal Strategies</strong></p>

							<p>Asserting yourself is an important aspect of taking control of your life. If someone&#39;s behavior is making you feel uncomfortable, upset, or scared, then confront the person. You should identify the behavior, criticize it, and let them know what you want them to do. For instance, you could say, &quot;You&#39;re constantly touching me, and I don&#39;t like it. Stop it.&quot; You should avoid using the word &quot;please&quot; when you&#39;re asserting yourself.</p>

							<p>If someone is bothering you in a public place, make a scene. This will be much more embarrassing for the person than it is for you. Your voice is also a weapon. Yelling will alert others and may startle an attacker. It may also help channel your fear into aggression, so you should scream &quot;NO&quot; loudly from your stomach.</p>

							<p>Trust your instincts. If something seems off, it probably is. For example, if someone is following you and makes you feel uneasy, believe your instinct and take action. You could confront the person, get to safety, call someone for help, or get a weapon ready. A cellular phone is a handy tool to have in case of an emergency. It is not expensive if it&#39;s for emergency use only. You can summon help from anywhere and even use it as a weapon if you know how.</p>

							<p>If a physical confrontation occurs, use your voice. Scream loudly as you strike. This serves multiple purposes. First, you may startle the attacker with a sudden loud scream. Second, you are attracting attention to yourself, and someone might come to your aid. Third, you are producing witnesses who can be useful if you inflict physical harm to the attacker. In self-defense, it may come down to your word versus theirs. If a passerby heard you scream &quot;Let go, let go,&quot; then that becomes evidence. Screaming also tenses up your abdominal region, so if you get hit at the same time, you are less likely to be out of breath.</p>

							<p><strong>Direct Relationship of Space And Danger</strong></p>

							<p>The amount of time you have to react to your aggressor&#39;s movements is directly related to your proximity to them. Therefore, the further away you are, the more time you have to respond. To ensure that you have enough time to react, it is essential to maintain a safe distance that you are comfortable with. If possible, it is also advisable to position yourself behind an obstacle that creates a barrier between you and the other person. It&#39;s important to note that the aggressor has the upper hand when it comes to the action-response cycle because they know when they will strike. However, your brain needs to process their actions, decide how to respond, and send signals to your muscles to move accordingly. This is why it&#39;s crucial to adopt a defensive stance, such as the interview stance, and keep a safe distance.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Contrasts between Martial Arts and Self-Defense</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>

							<p>Traditional martial arts often focus on Kata, which are choreographed sequences of moves and techniques, designed to simulate fighting one or more opponents. These often require speed, power, good balance, and flexibility. While Kata can be a valuable training tool, they provide little assistance in practical modern self-defense situations. Many traditional martial arts don&#39;t prepare you for when an attacker comes in close contact or takes you to the ground, as these techniques may not be allowed under the rules of a particular style. It&#39;s important to remember that in a real-world street fight or assault, anything goes.</p>

							<p>Imagine two athletes facing off against each other in a tournament. They&#39;ve trained for a long time, and they&#39;re in good physical shape. Now, let&#39;s remove the referee and the rules they were there to enforce. Anything goes; the fighters aren&#39;t limited to the same set of moves they&#39;re accustomed to. Let&#39;s take away the gloves, foot pads, headgear, groin protector, and mouthguard. We&#39;ll replace the mat with concrete and add some brick walls. Let&#39;s take away the lighting, too.</p>

							<p>We&#39;ll remove the crowd and anyone else who might have jumped in to break up the fight, leaving one person beaten beyond unconsciousness. Let&#39;s change the environment to a back alley, a kitchen, a bedroom, or even a bar. We&#39;ll provide all the weapons in each of these environments, such as glass, steel bars, screwdrivers, knives, and other items that can be used as weapons. In these situations, a different mentality is required, one that isn&#39;t necessarily covered in a typical martial arts class.</p>

							<p>To effectively defend yourself in a real-world scenario, it&#39;s important to learn techniques that focus on practical self-defense rather than just sport. This includes being aware of your surroundings, identifying potential threats, and learning techniques for dealing with a variety of situations. It&#39;s also crucial to have a mindset that&#39;s focused on survival and not just winning. The techniques taught in self-defense classes are designed to be effective in real-world situations and are often simpler and more direct than traditional martial arts techniques.</p>

							<p>Street encounters often start with a surprise attack, such as a mugging or an attempted rape, rather than a prepared stand-off. Even skilled martial artists can fall apart in such situations due to the required mentality, and techniques that work in a training hall might not be practical on the street, especially in confined spaces. Thus, it is essential to be mentally prepared for a street fight, as well as to train in a way that simulates real-life situations.</p>

							<p>Rather than take chances, it is wise to avoid or break away from potential attackers. Training partners should be asked to stand firm and make it hard to respond with the necessary techniques. It is also important to practice with full-on blows, using padded gear to simulate the force of a real attack. Otherwise, if always pulling punches 2 inches away from hitting the object in training, chances are that one&#39;s innate reaction under pressure might be the same.</p>

							<p>An expert in a specific martial arts style does not necessarily mean they are an authority in self-defense. In some cases, they may be, but the two do not necessarily go hand in hand. Hollywood often glamorizes violent scenes with a hero using a range of fancy strategies against multiple aggressors with various weapons, but the reality is that these situations are often bloody, ghastly, dirty, and end in injury or death. Survivors of such situations might end up with broken bones, facial injuries, or other physical and mental scars that may never fully heal.</p>

							<p><strong>Fear</strong></p>

							<p>Take a moment to consider what causes fear within us. It&#39;s the realization that the person in front of us could cause us serious harm, disfigurement or even death. We have loved ones at home - children, spouses, friends, and others - who are waiting for us, and we may never see them again.</p>

							<p>In such situations, it&#39;s crucial to remind ourselves that we have the right to return home to our loved ones, and this despicable individual should not deny us that right. Our family and friends need us, and we need them, so we must find the courage to face our fear and do what is necessary to protect ourselves and return home safely.</p>

							<p><strong>Getting Home: Doing Whatever It Takes</strong></p>

							<p>If that means sticking your fingers deep into somebody&rsquo;s eyes, then so be it. It&#39;s important to start thinking more about what you will do to protect yourself instead of what your attacker might do to you.</p>

							<p>During an encounter, it is normal to feel a surge of adrenaline, which can often be mistaken for fear, especially if you are not used to it. The body may tremble, legs may feel weak, there may be loss of bowel control, and the mind may go blank. These are all common symptoms of adrenaline as the body prepares itself for fight or flight. However, adrenaline can also give you extra speed and force, so it is there to assist you.</p>

							<p>Always remember that you are worth it! If you are ever assaulted, do not worry about what the attacker might do to you. Instead, focus on learning how to protect yourself, so you can worry more about what you will do to them! Once you have made the decision to fight, there is no holding back. Give it everything you have got.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Techniques and Tools for Body Posture</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Familiarity Is Important</strong></p>

							<p><strong>When Being Interviewed</strong></p>

							<p>Prior to any physical confrontation, it is important to stand in a comfortable and prepared position. Begin by positioning your feet shoulder-width apart and opening your hands at chest level while tucking your elbows away. Keep a close eye on your aggressor, focusing on their chest to detect any motion from their hands or feet. It is advisable to maintain a distance of at least six feet to provide enough response time. By doing so, you will be in a safer position, alert, and ready to protect yourself. Make sure to keep your elbows tucked away to protect your body, and your hands close to your head so that you can move them quickly to shield your face if necessary.</p>

							<p><strong>When In Defense Mode</strong></p>

							<p>Assume a defensive stance by stepping back with your dominant side, the shoulder and leg on that side moving backwards (for instance, your right side if you are right-handed). This allows you to generate more power with your dominant hand or foot when you strike. Stepping back instead of forward also creates a bit more distance between you and the aggressor, which gives you more time to react. Tuck your chin, keep your hands high to protect your face, and bring your elbows in to protect your ribs. Initially, this posture may feel uncomfortable, so practice it enough times until you feel comfortable. Stagger your legs to widen your base and increase stability, and bend your knees slightly to further enhance your balance. This Defensive Stance provides excellent protection and balance, enabling you to move quickly into striking positions.</p>

							<p><strong>Your Body Is Your Tool</strong></p>

							<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the defensive tools that your body naturally has. This includes:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Fists: Used to punch with force, the fist is a powerful tool for striking an opponent in close combat.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Hands: The hands can be used for striking, blocking, or grabbing an opponent&#39;s limbs. They are versatile tools for both offensive and defensive maneuvers.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">&bull; Fingers: The fingers can be used to poke or jab an opponent&#39;s eyes, throat, or other vulnerable areas. They can also be used for gripping and manipulating an opponent&#39;s limbs.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Head: The head can be used to deliver a powerful headbutt to an opponent&#39;s face, nose, or chin. It can also be used for blocking or deflecting incoming strikes.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Elbows: The elbows can be used to strike an opponent&#39;s head, face, or body with great force. They are also useful for blocking and trapping an opponent&#39;s limbs.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Knees: The knees can be used for striking an opponent&#39;s legs, groin, or body. They are also useful for clinching and controlling an opponent&#39;s movement.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Feet: The feet can be used for striking an opponent with kicks or stomps. They are also useful for controlling distance and movement in a fight.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Butt: The butt can be used for striking an opponent in close combat or for pushing them away. It can also be used for blocking or deflecting incoming strikes.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Hips: The hips can be used for generating power in strikes and throws. They are also useful for pivoting and changing direction quickly in a fight.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>How about target areas? Target these:</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Groin: The area between the upper thighs and the lower abdomen, a sensitive area that can cause intense pain when struck.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Eyes: The vulnerable organs located in the eye sockets, striking them can cause temporary blindness, pain and disorientation.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Throat: The front part of the neck, a vulnerable area that can cause breathing difficulties or even death if struck hard.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Solar Plexus: The area located in the upper abdomen between the ribcage and navel, a sensitive area that can cause shortness of breath, pain and discomfort if struck.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Knees: The joints connecting the thigh bone to the lower leg bone, a vulnerable area that can cause instability or immobilization if struck.</li>
								<li style="list-style-type:disc">Instep: The top part of the foot, a vulnerable area that can cause pain and disorientation if struck with a hard object.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Knowing the vulnerable spots of an attacker is crucial regardless of their size. You can increase the force of your strikes by following specific steps. Additionally, screaming with each strike not only startles the attacker but also alerts people nearby and channels fear into aggressiveness.</p>

							<p>To practice striking, observe potential targets on people while talking to them or simply watching them. Consider the different strikes you can use for each target you have in mind. Remember, when it comes to striking, use whatever works for you, regardless of whether it is from a textbook or not.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Positioning And Striking</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Increase the Intensity</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>

							<p>Targeting the eyes, nose, throat, solar plexus, groin, Instep, and shins are effective places to begin with, as they are easily accessible and can be targeted with various types of hits. While the groin can be a very effective target, it shouldn&#39;t be the only focus. Men tend to react quickly to groin strikes, so it&#39;s best to save this target for close aggressors. Hits can be made more effective in several ways, such as bracing the target area by using a wall or the floor or confining the individual or limb in place while striking. When striking, aim not just at the target area but about six inches past it. Keeping your strike in contact for a count helps produce the maximum transfer of energy, and hitting with a bigger surface gives a better carry-over of energy. Striking the same target area multiple times can also be effective, and screaming can help center your energy into your strike.</p>

							<p>In general, it&#39;s best to strike with hard to soft or soft to hard techniques. For example, you can use your elbow to strike the ribs, or your knee to strike the femoral area. You can also use your knee to strike the groin or your head to strike the nose. Alternatively, you can use your palms to strike the head. By using this approach, you can generate maximum force and impact, which can help you to defend yourself effectively.</p>

							<p>Punching to the head is not advisable due to the high risk of breaking knuckles and fingers. Moreover, the human head is hard, which makes it difficult to cause significant damage to an attacker with punches. Additionally, there is a risk of contracting infections such as HIV or hepatitis if the attacker&#39;s teeth puncture the knuckles during the punch. Instead, using the palm of the hand to strike can produce the same amount of force with less risk of injury.</p>

							<p>When targeting tender areas, such as pressure points or motor nerve points, full-on strikes may result in permanent damage, and even a 5% hit can have an effect on individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to be careful while hitting such areas. Striking these areas can induce unconsciousness or even shut down that limb.</p>

							<p>However, caution must be exercised while striking the throat or eyes, as it can cause permanent damage or even result in death. These techniques should only be used in real self-defense situations and treated with the utmost care during training.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Basic Hold Escapes</strong></p>

							<p><strong>What It&rsquo;s All About</strong></p>

							<p>When an aggressor seizes you, it&#39;s essential to go into a defensive posture with your dominant side backwards. This posture will make you more stable and harder for the aggressor to pull you around. A quick strike to a tender area, such as a well-executed shin kick, may end the confrontation on the spot. If not, it will at least act as a distraction, relaxing the aggressor&#39;s grip. Other distractions can include a slap to the head, a poke to the solar plexus, a foot stamp, or even spitting.</p>

							<p>To break free from the hold, pull back on the arm being held and drive your free arm in the opposite direction against the aggressor&#39;s hold. This hit will have twice the force of simply pulling or hitting. By rotating your body, you&#39;re engaging some of your body&#39;s bigger muscle groups against the hold, increasing your chances of getting free. It&#39;s also important to yell as you hit and strike the aggressor in a frail area such as the eyes, throat, groin, solar plexus, or femorals.</p>

							<p>During this process, it&#39;s crucial to give it your all. Your life might depend on it. This will buy you some time, and while the aggressor is preoccupied with whether they will see or breathe again, you can break free and run to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>1st Wrist Hold</strong></p>

							<p>To escape from a wrist grab, start by stepping back into a defensive posture with your dominant side back. Next, draw back the arm that&#39;s being held and use your free arm to strike the aggressor&#39;s arm in the opposite direction, twisting your body to increase the force of the hit. This should help you break free. At the same time, you can also distract the aggressor by hitting them in vulnerable areas like the eyes or throat. If you need to, you can also use other types of hits to disable the aggressor, such as a hard shin kick. Once you&#39;ve created an opening, run to safety as quickly as possible.</p>

							<p><strong>2nd Wrist Hold</strong></p>

							<p>Take a step back into a defensive posture with your dominant side backward. Then, drive your elbows down and turn your wrists somewhat inward as you pull your arms through the aggressor&#39;s thumbs to break free. Follow up with a hard shin kick or target vulnerable areas like the eyes or throat with your fingers before running to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>3rd Wrist Grab Behind</strong></p>

							<p>If an attacker grabs your wrists, step forward into a defensive posture and lift your knee, driving your foot onto their instep. Then, punch your arm out of their grasp and force your elbow back into their solar plexus. After that, quickly run to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Escaping A Hair Hold</strong></p>

							<p>When the attacker grabs your hair, step forward into a defensive posture. Immediately get a grip on one or two of their digits and bend them backward. Hold the fingers in a lock or break them if possible. If necessary, use a shin kick to disable the attacker and create an opportunity to escape to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Escaping Bear Hug</strong></p>

							<p>If an attacker seizes you from behind, start by dropping your weight and broadening your stance to increase stability. Then, drive your knuckle joint repeatedly into the back of the aggressor&rsquo;s hands. Next, shoot your head backward into the aggressor&#39;s face. Deliver a hard hit to the groin using an open hand, but also grab, shake, and tear off whatever you can to inflict as much pain as possible. Finally, run to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Escaping a Head Lock</strong></p>

							<p>When the aggressor tries to grab you, quickly place your hands on the sides of your head to prevent their arm from encircling your neck. Slip beneath their arm as they try to clinch while maintaining a grip on their arm. Continue holding the aggressor&#39;s arm and drive your knee into the nerve-femoralis, which is located a few inches above the knee on the outside of the leg. Push the aggressor away and flee to safety.</p>

							<p><strong>Escaping Punches</strong></p>

							<p>When the aggressor throws punches, take a step back and assume a defensive posture with your hands up in front of your face. The aggressor&#39;s natural response is to punch around your hands in a hook punch or arm-swing. Adjust your elbow to block any punches thrown. Precise alignment of the elbow joint is not necessary as your arms are also part of the block. This block itself can cause significant harm to the aggressor.</p>

							<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

							<p>When out and about, it&#39;s important to be aware of your surroundings. If you&#39;re walking down the street, pay attention to whether or not someone is following you. If you&#39;re running or walking alone and wearing headphones, your awareness is reduced.</p>

							<p>When you&#39;re out walking, be sure to keep your hands out of your pockets so you&#39;re ready to use them if necessary. Walk confidently, even if you&#39;re not entirely sure where you&#39;re going, and keep your head and eyes up. It&#39;s also a good idea to look at oncoming traffic.</p>

							<p>If you notice a car driving by you repeatedly or someone sitting outside your work or school, don&#39;t hesitate to let someone know. It&#39;s also a good idea to avoid walking in dark alleys or areas, and to always let someone know where you are and what time you expect to be somewhere. If you see something unusual, trust your instincts and avoid it.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;re walking or running alone, don&#39;t wear headphones and be cautious about giving out personal information over the phone. Make eye contact with people you pass to let them know you&#39;ve seen them. If you feel threatened, don&#39;t be afraid to yell for help.</p>

							<p>It&#39;s never a good idea to hitchhike, and be cautious when using ATMs at night. If you carry a handbag with a shoulder strap, be prepared to let it go if it&#39;s snatched. It&#39;s also important to keep a safe distance from strangers who approach you for directions.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;re dropping someone off at their house, make sure they&#39;re safely inside before you drive away. If you see an accident or someone stranded on the side of the road, report it from your cell phone or the nearest phone. Take self-defense classes and practice with friends and loved ones to build confidence in your ability to protect yourself.</p>

							<p>Millions of people worldwide have realized the effectiveness and protection of a safe room, thanks to the Jodie Foster movie &quot;Safe Room&quot;. However, a safe room doesn&#39;t have to be as high-tech as the one in the movie. It just needs to be more secure than a regular room. Many preppers have bunkers and fallout shelters as alternative locations in case of a crisis that destroys or compromises their homes.</p>

							<p>Building a safe room may or may not be feasible depending on where you live. It&#39;s best to hire a professional to construct it for you. In countries with higher risk levels such as Iraq, etc., a safe room may be a necessity for both homes and offices. In fact, even offices and buildings in higher risk areas will have safe rooms for staff to take refuge in.</p>

							<p>If you&#39;re planning on building a safe room, there are a few essential tips you should be aware of.</p>

							<ol>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Interaction</strong></li>
							</ol>

							<p style="margin-left:48px">It&#39;s crucial for the safe room to have multiple means of communication with the outside world to ensure assistance can be sought if needed. Failure to do so could result in being trapped in the safe room, unsure of whether it&#39;s safe to exit.</p>

							<p style="margin-left:48px">To establish communication, it&#39;s recommended to have a landline telephone, a mobile phone, and a panic button linked to a security agency that specializes in emergency response. In the event of taking shelter in a safe room, external help is usually required to secure the area and make it safe.</p>

							<ol start="2">
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Nourishment and hydration.</strong></li>
							</ol>

							<p style="margin-left:48px">Adequate provisions of nourishment and hydration must be stocked in the safe room to sustain the occupants for a few days.</p>

							<ol start="3">
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>First Aid Kit</strong></li>
							</ol>

							<p style="margin-left:48px">In the event of an injury, the first aid kit will be essential.</p>

							<ol start="4">
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>FireProof &amp; Bullet Proof Shelter</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Fire Extinguishers</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Sleeping Essentials</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Lightings And Extra Battery</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Radio</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Self Defence Tools</strong></li>
								<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><strong>Toiletries</strong></li>
							</ol>

							<p>To sum up, it&#39;s crucial that the security company is aware of the location of your safe room and they may need to survey your home to create a map of the exact location. This will enhance their effectiveness during a rescue mission. In conclusion, constructing a safe room is an excellent idea, and if feasible within your space and budget, it&#39;s recommended to build one. Alternatively, you can consider building a bunker as a substitute if constructing a safe room in your own home is not feasible.</p>

							<p>Stress is a common part of life, but it can escalate quickly in times of crisis. Whether it&#39;s a natural disaster like a flood or hurricane, or being in a warzone, such traumatic events can leave you feeling on edge.</p>

							<p>When you&#39;re stressed, you may experience physical symptoms like a racing heart, upset stomach, profuse sweating, and dizziness. You may find yourself easily agitated or angered by small things, and even startle or feel scared more frequently.</p>

							<p>In addition to physical symptoms, stress can take a toll on your mental health. You may feel depressed, unable to focus or concentrate, have bad dreams, and negative thoughts that make it difficult to sleep. These are all symptoms of stress-related trauma.</p>

							<p>Fortunately, there are ways to combat stress and keep your sanity in times of crisis. In this article, we&#39;ll provide six tips that you can use to manage stress and calm yourself down. By implementing these strategies, you&#39;ll be better equipped to handle chaotic situations without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

							<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Visualize. </strong>Using visualization techniques is comparable to practicing the law of attraction. Through picturing serene scenarios or achieving desired goals, you can mentally detach yourself from the challenging situation at hand. As the saying goes, &quot;It&#39;s all about mind over matter. If you don&#39;t mind, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Imagine things improving, assistance arriving to alleviate your burdens, and other positive scenarios to boost your morale. Harness the power of positive visualization to maintain a positive outlook.</p>

							<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Deep Breathing. </strong>
							Engaging in yoga is an excellent method for reducing stress levels. However, if you are unfamiliar with yoga, taking deep breaths is a simple and effective way to calm your mind and provide your body with oxygen. Breathe deeply, hold your breath for four counts, and then slowly exhale. Repeating this process a few times can leave you feeling refreshed and reinvigorated.</p>

							<p><strong>Tip #3</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Planning. </strong>When you&#39;re in a crisis, planning can give you a sense of control over the situation. Feeling helpless and not knowing what to do can be a major source of stress for many people. This feeling of helplessness can lead to panic and anxiety.</p>

							<p>However, by taking the time to plan your next steps and being proactive, you can regain a sense of control and reduce your stress levels. Planning is a proactive approach that can help you feel more confident in handling the situation, which in turn can help you avoid feelings of despair and hopelessness.</p>

							<p><strong>Tip#4</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Educate &amp; Talk About It. </strong>
							To ease the burden of stress, it is important to communicate with family members and anyone else who is present with you about the situation. By vocalizing your thoughts, you can release pent-up emotions and feel a sense of relief.</p>

							<p><strong>Tip #5</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Dont Forget to Excercise. </strong>
							Engaging in physical activity can be one of the best ways to alleviate stress. In times of crisis, there will likely be a lot of physical tasks to complete, so keep yourself moving and try to get as much exercise as possible. Physical activity can help keep your mind occupied, preventing it from slipping into negative thought patterns. As the saying goes, &quot;an idle mind is the devil&#39;s workshop.&quot;</p>

							<p><strong>Tip #6</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Daily Routine. </strong>
							Create and stick to a daily routine, even in the midst of chaos. The predictability of a daily routine can help to reduce stress during tumultuous times. Don&#39;t forget the usual stress management techniques that work for you, and use them when you start to feel overwhelmed. Building mental toughness means finding the strength to keep going, even when you feel like you have nothing left in the tank. Remember that in difficult times, the key is to persevere and keep moving forward.</p>
