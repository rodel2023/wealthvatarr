                If money and wealth is the main character of the show, you would be its adversary because you believe that it is the main cause of chaos, hence, you inherently feel disconnected about it. An Adversary has a love/hate relationship with money. There are times that they reject money, thinking that it is the root of all evil and nothing good will come from having too much of it. There are also times that they feel good about being able to save to buy the things they want. They feel anxious talking about money but at the same time, they appreciate that it can buy the things that make them truly happy. 
                <br>
                An Adversary is a very good speaker, always carrying a purpose whenever they speak publicly. They listen to those who are exploited and helpless, then turn their woes and cries into calls for actions. An Adversary speaks with persuasion. They feel like they are blessed with such a talent to be the voice of many. Most Adversaries focus on their advocacies and let other people handle the financial matters to them.

        <p class="p-style"> 
            Good question. Let&rsquo;s start with knowing the importance of superpowers and strengths.
            <br> <br>
            First of all, research has already shown that there are certain qualities that ancient humans have evolved overtime to resist extreme weather and endure stress. 
            These amazing traits are what made humans stand the attack of nature and made them thrive in extreme situations.
            <br> <br>
            Research further concluded that these skills and abilities can still be further developed according to one&rsquo;s limits.
            <br>
            The same goes to one&rsquo;s inner traits.
            <br> <br>
            One&rsquo;s superpowers are said to be the easiest ones to develop further &ndash; and these developed superpowers would be your fastest way to grow your wealth and cultivate a success mindset.
            <br> <br>
            As THE ADVERSARY, here are the superpowers which you can focus on to build your first wealth base:

                    This is one the best assets of an adversary. A focused person never gives up on any challenge. When they accept a responsibility, they commit to it until it&rsquo;s done. They do not let emotions stop them. They do not postpone anything that can be done today. They are very good multi-taskers, without leaving any important details behind.

                    An Adversary knows how to stand on his belief. They believe that they are in the world to inspire and lead people towards better life, sans the talk about money. They believe that they can make their friends, family, and acquaintances find their own happiness that do not involve money. They relate their situation and good experiences to inspire people. An Adversary is a very good speaker with an aim to persuade.
                    <br>
                    An adversary has the best commanding skills to make a person work towards their personal and team goals in a group. They have leadership qualities to bind people and team players together. Social entrepreneurs are usually the people with an adversary skills.

                    This stems from the fact that they don&rsquo;t accept money as something that will be a catalyst of change and goodness among people. Adversaries lack financial goals because they avoid the thought that they need it to be content in life. But deep inside, they feel happy that they have enough money to sustain their needs and some of their wants.
                    This is one of the hardest challenges for an Adversary. Their mindset is geared towards positive change and contentment without the money involved. They often forget that people will eventually look for money, and lack of knowledge about financial matters can result in disastrous consequences &ndash; such as lack of retirement fund, lack of health care budget, and lack of a comfortable lifestyle.

This goes up as you grow older and whether you are suffering from a serious ailment.

                    The first step to diminish the costs and your risk of hospitalization is prevention and insurance procurement.

It may sound contrary, especially if happiness is associated with money. However, it is also shown in different studies that happiness is associated with the income level. Sometimes, spending a little bit for our wants can become a big motivation which can result to better wealth generation.

                    Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment.

            These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want to watch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It&rsquo;s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you.
