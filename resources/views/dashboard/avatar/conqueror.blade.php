			The Conqueror loves big and risky assets. They play the get-rich-quick game no matter how big the involved money is. Just like a rebel, a Conqueror loves challenging the norms by their creative ideas. They have their own ways of doing things and they love the track that&rsquo;s not being used by many.  They are the best person to ask about financial complexities. Numbers are their friends, but sometimes, a Conqueror bravely takes on a challenge even without enough data and backup plan. When they win, they win big. But when they lose, they lose a lot.  You have your own set of approaches and practices when it comes to risk-taking and creativity. This attitude is what makes you unstoppable from pursuing the things you want.  In short, you believe that your long-term goals can be easily achieved by taking the road less traveled.

                    Good question. Let&rsquo;s start with knowing the importance of superpowers and strengths.
                    <br>
                    First of all, research has already shown that there are certain qualities that ancient humans have evolved overtime to resist

            These amazing traits are what made humans stand the attack of nature and made them thrive in extreme situations.
            <br>
            Research further concluded that these skills and abilities can still be further developed according to one&rsquo;s limits.
            <br>
            The same goes to one&rsquo;s inner traits.
            <br>
            One&rsquo;s superpowers are said to be the easiest ones to develop further &ndash; and these developed superpowers would be your fastest way to grow your wealth and cultivate a success mindset.
            <br>
            <strong>As THE CONQUEROR, here are the superpowers which you can focus on to build your first wealth base:</strong>

                A Conqueror usually has his long-term and short-term goals completely and clearly laid out in front of him &ndash; and this is the reason why he takes on every challenge no matter how risky it may get. Your favorite line is similar to &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what happens&rdquo; because your own way of getting the things you want is different from the norms. You place the highest bets on the unconventional ways of building your wealth. This is so that when you win, you know you will win big time and that&rsquo;s equivalent to one goal slashed as achieved from your bucketlist.

Quitting is the last option, because on the mind of a conqueror, the world has never-ending ideas. They always aspire to see their ideas come to life and take the responsibility of doing so.&nbsp;

                Conquerors cannot delegate significant work, because of this fear of sabotage. Besides, you think that your own creative ways can bring the best results and only you could do it the way you wanted it to be.

                    Conquerors have in mind that they will never fail, hence, they take every risk they know of. However, practicality and today&rsquo;s uncertainty necessitate the need for a backup plan. When the pandemic kicks in, a lot of thriving businesses were forced to shut down without hint of return. Managers and executives were forced to look for other jobs, media personalities and celebrities started looking for better jobs somewhere. Even the rich are asking their financial managers and advisors of the best thing to do when their investment plummets as the economy is constantly falling.

                    <br>
                    Take for example the story of Patricia Kluge.
                    <br>
                    After getting a high-settlement divorce from a wealthy husband, Kluge invested so much of her money by opening a winery and investing into real estate. When the housing market crashed, she lost everything she invested. The bank foreclosed her winery and subdivision. She battled these cases with attorneys around the world to try and save her business ventures. She ended up filing bankruptcy and auctioning off her jewelry and luxurious assets.

His video guy started expanding his advertising job to those connected to Cordone and that he did not &ldquo;start a doughnut shop&rdquo; to get multiple streams of income. Cordone calls this symbiotic flows and warned that adding disconnected flows may not work in providing you with better wealth.

                    <br>
                    Your obsession with money is understandable. No one wants to compromise their financial stability and choose material happiness which are usually just temporary contentment.

            These fears are reasonable. You want to build wealth in the shortest possible time. You want to watch your savings grow instead of it diminishing over temporary happiness; hence, you would rather save all the money that you think is not really necessary in your day-to-day sustenance.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, these wants can sometimes be thought as motivation for you to perform well in your day job, get promotions, or think of a new business concept that can be the next big thing. It&rsquo;s possible that these wants not take up your savings funds, for you can let your money do the work for you.

					Financial coaches aim to help their clients get clear about their financial goals, habits, and money appetite. They teach people how to be responsible with their money and fix their financial practices.

A financial professional is not only for the wealthy people &ndash; these professionals cater to small businesses and those with day job who are looking to start or diversify their investment portfolio.
					<br>
					Wealth management and investment involves risks. Specific investment strategies and the amount to be involved depends particularly on the client. This is a case-to-case basis. Financial advisors provide their clients with individual plans to cater to their needs and specific goals.
