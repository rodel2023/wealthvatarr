			You are one of the few people blessed with the <b>best gifts</b> not given to many. Your superpowers are there (in fact, you know you can feel it in you!) but they are currently dormant. There are endless possibilities given your <b>unique set of gifts</b> – which are just sitting and waiting for you to realize it.
			<br> <br>
			Just recently, things are getting tough on your part, isn’t it? Unfortunate circumstances have happened which have surely worn you out over the past weeks. Things didn’t go as planned. You spent time and effort and even sacrificed a lot but the results and the turn of events just...didn’t favor you.
			<br> <br>
			I hope you don’t lose your spark and let those greatest attributes I’ve seen in you die just because of these unfortunate incidents.
			<br> <br>
			These are just signs that <b>big things are going to reveal</b> themselves.
			<br> <br>
			This is the time where your greatest superpower – that set of gifts I’m talking about – will be of use to reveal even better things. Your natural gifts are product of your childhood dreams. These dreams include wealth, quality relationships, good luck, and happiness.
			<br> <br>
			However, your full potential is being hindered by the <b>negative forces</b> lurking around someone with such an incredible set of gifts. These negative forces saw that your goals are without clarity and that’s where they attack. It is <b>critical that you realize what these are</b> or you would never know which one would be your greatest enemy, resulting in the futility of your natural gifts.
			<br> <br>
			I hope you are ready to know about your natural gifts…and brave enough to meet your weaknesses you didn’t have the courage to face before.

			<br> <br>

			<br> <br>
			You think that money is inherently evil. You avoid talking about it all the time. In fact, you are most likely to create and lead social movement to find genuine happiness without money involved.
